_Linear Algebra_ by Jim Hefferon is a Free text for an undergraduate mathematics course. It covers the standard topics: Gauss's method, vector spaces, linear maps, determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The PDF of _Linear Algebra_, and of the answer book, the beamer slides, and the lab manual, are at the book's web page, [hefferon.net/linearalgebra](https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra). You can also buy hard copies for minimal cost from booksellers such as Amazon for single-person copies, or from the college bookstore source if you are an instructor; see the web page for more information and links.

# Summary

What sets this book apart is its developmental approach. _Linear Algebra_ does not assume that students are mathematically sophisticated, so it includes lots of examples, lots of motivation, and clear exposition. At the same time, it helps instructors raise the level of sophistication of their students.  Consequently, everything is proved, and it nudges readers to see the advantages of a more advanced viewpoint-- in particular, vector spaces and linear maps appear as early as is practical.

In addition to the main text, every chapter ends with a few Topics that illustrate applications or extensions of the material. These are suitable for independent reading, for group work, or for a one-day presentation as a break.

There are many exercises; I have aimed for two dozen for each class day. The answer book contains completely-worked solutions for every exercise, including the proofs. The book and answer PDFs are arranged so that if you click on the question number then you are taken to the answer and if you click on the answer number then you come back to the question.

There are beamer slides for classroom use. These are keyed to the text, including that they use the same wording and numbering for theorems, definitions, etc.  The slides that I use pass over some proofs to instead do illustrative examples; there is also a version with all the proofs.

I have made [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwF3A0R8OzMoMlE1-SaEh8h9VqUlO-r52), based on the classroom slides, covering the entire semester.  If you are a classroom teacher, this is an additional resource (for some students, being able to pause or replay is helpful).  If you are studying on your own then these are essentially my classroom lectures put on videos.

And, there is a lab manual for computer work, using *Sage*. It introduces students to doing linear algebra on a computer and also introduces some important applications that are difficult by hand but easy on a machine.

# Award

_Linear Algebra_ is the recipient of the Mathematical Association of America's
[2020 Solow Award](https://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/daniel-solow-authors-award), which recognizes its
"impact on undergraduate education in mathematics."
