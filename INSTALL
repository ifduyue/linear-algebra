COMPILING

Why?

Sigh.  This is what I did for Linux, Ubuntu 20.  If you have some
other system such as Mac or Windows then I am unable to help, sorry.  For that
matter, if you have Linux then I will not help you either, sorry.

0) Install TeX Live.  You can get it from https://tug.org/texlive/ but
I just did this in a terminal.
  sudo apt-get install texlive-full

0.5) Change the ImageMagick policy.xml file.  I did
  sudo emacs /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
and found near the bottom a number of lines like this.
  <!-- disable ghostscript format types -->
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS" />
    ... total of six such policy lines ...
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="XPS" />
I understand the story to be that old versions of GhostScript had a
security flaw, and this sequence of lines turns off the described
conversions to avoid that flaw.  But we want the described conversions,
so comment them out by surrounding with <!-- and -->, as here.
  <!-- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS" /> -->

1) Get the linear-algebra archive.
  In your browser, visit https://gitlab.com/jim.hefferon/linear-algebra.  
  Download a .zip (it is the button between "Find file" and "Clone").
  mv ~/Downloads/linear-algebra-master.zip ~/Documents
  cd ~/Documents
  unzip linear-algebra-master
  mv linear-algebra-master linear-algebra

Note that the subdirectory must be called linear-algebra.  The scripts
expect that name.

3) Now you can make the book.  
    cd ~/Documents/linear-algebra/src
    make
(I had to install freeglut3.
  sudo apt-get install freeglut3
If something fails with a question mark prompt then probably you get out by
typing `x' and <return>.) 

At the end, you'll have book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf, along with the slides and
the lab. You could have just skipped the compiling.

To compile the version that is published in paper, change lines 10 and 11 in
bookjhconcrete.sty to be this.
  \booltrue{hardcopybool}  % uncomment this to make a book for publishing 
  % \boolfalse{hardcopybool}  % the default  
Then run ./make_book_for_web.sh.  You might also want to run this.
