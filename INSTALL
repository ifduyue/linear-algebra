INSTALLING

Put book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf in the same directory.  Point your pdf reader
at it.  I find that Acrobat Reader has some advantages (it shows opacity, for
instance), but all PDF readers that I have tried did pretty well.

Please note that you can buy a hardcopy of this book, for instance on Amazon,
at a cost that is less than it would take for you to print your own copy.
(Make sure that you are getting edition 4 as there are old versions
also for sale.  The newest edition costs the same, and is better.)  The
ISBN number of the latest printed version is at the book's home page.

COMPILING FROM SOURCE

Why?

This is a very big project.  Running this:
  $ find . -iname "*.tex" -or -iname "*.asy" -or -iname "*.sty" -iname "*.cls" -or -iname "*.mp" | xargs wc -l
gives 201327 total.  There are a lot of things for you to get to go. Are
you sure you want to compile from source?

Sigh.  OK, first know that the compilation uses `make'; you cannot just
run 'pdflatex book', it won't work.

This is what I did for Linux, Ubuntu 22, in 2022-Oct.  I followed these
steps from a fresh install.  If you have some  other system such as Mac
or Windows then I am unable to help, sorry.  For that matter, if you have
Linux then I will not help you either.  Sorry.

0) Install TeX Live.  You can get it from https://tug.org/texlive/ but
I just did this in a terminal.
  sudo apt-get install texlive-full

0.5) Change the ImageMagick policy.xml file.  I did
  sudo emacs /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
and found near the bottom a number of lines like this.
  <!-- disable ghostscript format types -->
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS" />
    ... total of six such policy lines ...
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="XPS" />
I understand the story to be that old versions of GhostScript had a
security flaw, and this sequence of lines turns off the described
conversions to avoid that flaw.  But we want the described conversions,
so comment them out by surrounding with <!-- and -->, as here.
  <!-- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PS" /> -->

1) Get the linear-algebra archive.
  In your browser, visit https://gitlab.com/jim.hefferon/linear-algebra.  
  Download a .zip (it is the button between "Find file" and "Clone").
  mv ~/Downloads/linear-algebra-master.zip ~/Documents
  cd ~/Documents
  unzip linear-algebra-master
  mv linear-algebra-master linear-algebra

Note that the subdirectory must be called linear-algebra, not
linear-algebra-master.  The scripts expect that name.

3) Now you can make the book.  
    cd ~/Documents/linear-algebra/src
    make
It can take some time.  It took my machine maybe ten or fifteen minutes.

(To get Asymptote to work I had to install freeglut3.
  sudo apt-get install freeglut3
If something fails with a question mark prompt then probably you get out by
typing `x' and <return>.) 

At the end, you'll have book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf, along with the slides.

4) The lab is separate because it is more complex (it involves installing
a couple of fonts) and not as many people will want to do it.  See
lab/INSTALL.

(To compile the version that is published in paper, change lines 10 and 11 in
bookjhconcrete.sty to be this.
  \booltrue{hardcopybool}  % uncomment this to make a book for publishing 
  % \boolfalse{hardcopybool}  % the default  
Then run make.)
