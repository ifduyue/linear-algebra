This is _Linear Algebra_ by Jim Hefferon.  The release date is 2016.
You are free to use this material, either under the GNU Free Documentation
license or under a Creative Commons Share Alike license.

Please note that you can buy a hardcopy of this book on Amazon, at a cost that
is less than it would take for you to run it off from the PDF at a local copy 
shop.  (Make sure that you are getting edition 4 as there are old versions
also for sale.  The newest edition costs the same, and is better.)

For more information, see README.md, or the web site

INSTALL

Put book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf in the same directory.  Point your pdf reader
at it.


COMPILING

Why?

Sigh.  OK.  Here is what I just did on a fresh Linux box (Ubuntu 14.04).
If you use Windows then I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

0) Install the Debian TeX Live (that is, the packages from the archive).
  (I'd rather go with TeX Live from tug.org but I had to get Sage and
  Asymptote also and they required me to get the Debian packages and ..)

  Also install Asymptote.

1) Clone the linear-algebra archive.  
  cd ~/Documents
  git clone https://gitlab.com/jim.hefferon/linear-algebra.git

2) Install the luximono font.

  cd ~/Downloads
  wget http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts 
  sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts
  sudo getnonfreefonts --sys --all
  sudo texhash

  (I don't believe this needs to be done anymore but I am leaving it just
  in case I misunderstood what happened:  I could not get it to find
  Luximono (running linear-algebra/make_book_for_web.sh says it can't
  find ul9r8r).  Following the directions on this page
    http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/TeX-on-Debian/ch4.html
  I did
    sudo mkdir /etc/texmf/updmap.d
    sudo emacs /etc/texmf/updmap.d/10local.cfg
  To the bottom of the file I added the line
    Map ul9.map
  (see http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2012-July/019397.html) and ran
    sudo update-updmap
    sudo texhash
    sudo updmap-sys
  and it now worked.)

3) I had to get updated packages from ctan becuase the Debian stuff is old:
    thmtools, geometry, mh
   and install them in /usr/local/share/tex/latex/ .  Then I had to generate 
   the .sty files
     cd  /usr/local/share/tex/latex/thmtools
     sudo pdflatex thmtools.ins
     cd  /usr/local/share/tex/latex/geometry
     sudo pdflatex geometry.ins
   and, just for a change of pace,
     cd  /usr/local/share/tex/latex/mh
     sudo tex mhsetup
     sudo tex breqn.dtx
     sudo tex empheq
     sudo tex flexisym
     sudo tex mathstyle
     sudo tex mathtools

4) Now I can run the shell script that generates the book.  
    cd ~/Documents/linear-algebra/src
    make
    make 

At the end, you'll have book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf.  Put them
in the same directory.  You could have just skipped the compiling, you know.

To compile the version that is published in paper, change to
  cd ~/Documents/linear-algebra/src
  make hardcopy=1
  make hardcopy=1

Note that making the slides can take some time, maybe ten minutes.
