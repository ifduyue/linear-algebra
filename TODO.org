TODO list for Linear Algebra http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra 


* Look through bug reports

** Make theorems come out shaded in print book.  Perhaps I must provided a grey-shaded area, instead of yellow-shaded, since the yellow does not produce any shade in the print editions.

* New material

** Include handwritten versions of lower case Greek letters on flyleaf?

** Topic on Principle Components
** Get source for four_minute_mile.pdf, moneyball.pdf
* Refactor some code 
** Add determinant to Lab Manual.
* Give it a less-flat format
* e-book format?
  Tried breqn but changing the equation* environment on line 1938 of gr1.tex
  to dmath* did not result in a break.  Puzzled.

** Convert to ebook, using the newly-available options through tex4ht
** See if can document them whil I do it.
