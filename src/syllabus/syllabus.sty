\newcommand{\credithoursdisclaimer}{\section{Credit Hours Statement}
You should expect to devote a minimum of ten hours per week to this 
course.
For a start, you must come to class.
That's three hours.
In addition, you should expect to spend 
at least seven hours per week outside of class on readings, 
homework, studying after class and preparing for the next one, 
and reviewing material for quizzes and exams.}

\newcommand{\gradedisclaimer}{\section{Meaning of your course grade}
  A $D$ tells you that although you will get credit for this 
  course, you have dead-ended:~you are not prepared for following 
  courses.
  A $C$ says that you are minimally prepared for following courses but
  you should expect to have to work hard there.
  Do not consider a $C$ an acceptable grade; it is a warning that you have
  gaps that you must fill.
  In contrast, a $B$ states my judgement that you are well-prepared to
  move up to the next level.
  Finally, an $A$ marks superior performance and is the way that I 
  get to recognize your work and encourage you to go on.
