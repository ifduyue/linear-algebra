\section{Linear Independence}
The prior section shows how to understand a vector space
as a span, 
as an unrestricted linear combination of some of its elements.
For example, the space of linear polynomials $\set{a+bx\suchthat a,b\in\Re}$ 
is spanned by the set $\set{1,x}$.
The prior section also showed that a space can have many sets that span it.
Two more sets that span the space of linear polynomials are 
$\set{1,2x}$ and $\set{1,x,2x}$.

At the end of that section we described some spanning sets as `minimal'
but we never precisely defined that word.
% We could mean one of two things.
We could mean that a spanning set is minimal if it 
contains the smallest number of members of any set with the same span,
so that $\set{1,x,2x}$ is not minimal because it has 
three members while we can give two-element sets spanning the same space.
Or we could mean that a spanning set is minimal when it has no elements 
that we can remove without changing the span.
Under this meaning $\set{1,x,2x}$ is not minimal because 
removing the \( 2x \) to get \( \set{1,x} \) leaves the
span unchanged.

The first sense of minimality appears to be a global requirement, 
in that to check if a spanning set is minimal 
we seemingly must look at all the sets that span 
and find one with the least number of elements. 
The second sense of minimality is local since
we need to look only at the set and consider the
span with and without various elements.
For instance, using the second sense
we could compare the span of $\set{1,x,2x}$ 
with the span of $\set{1,x}$ and
note that $2x$ is a ``repeat'' in that 
its removal doesn't shrink the span.

In this section we will use the second sense of `minimal spanning set'
because of this technical convenience.
However, the most important result of this book is that the two senses 
coincide.
We will prove that in the next section.


 






\subsection{Definition and Examples}

We saw ``repeats'' in the first chapter.
There, Gauss's Method turned them into 
$0=0$ equations.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:StaticsLIAndLD}
Recall the \hyperlink{ex:Statics}{Statics} example from
Chapter One's opening.
We got two balances with the pair of unknown-mass objects, one 
at \( 40 \)~cm and \( 15 \)~cm and another 
at \( -50 \)~cm and \( 25 \)~cm, and
we then computed the value of those masses.
Had we instead gotten the second balance at
\( 20 \)~cm and \( 7.5 \)~cm
then Gauss's Method on the resulting two-equations, two-unknowns system
would not have yielded a solution, it would have yielded a $0=0$ equation 
along with an equation containing a free variable.
Intuitively, the problem is that \( \rowvec{20 &7.5} \) is half of 
$\rowvec{40 &15}$, that is,
$\rowvec{20 &7.5}$ is in the span of the set $\set{\rowvec{40 &15}}$
and so is repeated data.
We would have been trying to 
solve a two-unknowns problem with essentially only one piece of information.
\end{example}
 
We take $\vec{v}$ to be a ``repeat''
of the vectors in a set~$S$ if $\vec{v}\in\spanof{S}$ so
that it depends on, that is, is expressible in terms of, 
elements of the set 
$\vec{v}=c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n$.

\begin{lemma} \label{lm:AddVecSpanNoGrowIffVecInSpan}
%<*lm:AddVecSpanNoGrowIffVecInSpan>
Where $V$ is a vector space, $S$ is a subset of that space, and $\vec{v}$
is an element of that space, 
$\spanof{S\union\set{\vec{v}}} = \spanof{S}$
if and only if 
$\vec{v}\in\spanof{S}$.
%</lm:AddVecSpanNoGrowIffVecInSpan>
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
%<*pf:AddVecSpanNoGrowIffVecInSpan0>
Half of the if and only if is immediate: if $\vec{v}\notin\spanof{S}$ then 
the sets are not equal because $\vec{v}\in\spanof{S\union\set{\vec{v}}}$.

For the other half assume that $\vec{v}\in\spanof{S}$
so that $\vec{v}=c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n$ for some scalars~$c_i$
and vectors $\vec{s}_i\in S$.
We will use mutual containment to show that the sets
$\spanof{S\union\set{\vec{v}}}$ and $\spanof{S}$ are equal.
The containment $\spanof{S\union\set{\vec{v}}}\supseteq\spanof{S}$ is clear.
%</pf:AddVecSpanNoGrowIffVecInSpan0>

%<*pf:AddVecSpanNoGrowIffVecInSpan1>
To show containment in the other direction let $\vec{w}$ be an element 
of~$\spanof{S\union\set{\vec{v}}}$.
Then $\vec{w}$ is a linear combination of elements of 
$S\union\set{\vec{v}}$, which we can write as 
$\vec{w}=c_{n+1}\vec{s}_{n+1}+\cdots+c_{n+k}\vec{s}_{n+k}+c_{n+k+1}\vec{v}$.
(Possibly some of the $\vec{s}_i$'s from $\vec{w}$'s equation are the same as
some of those from $\vec{v}$'s equation but that does not matter.)
Expand $\vec{v}$.
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{w}=c_{n+1}\vec{s}_{n+1}+\cdots+c_{n+k}\vec{s}_{n+k}
            +c_{n+k+1}\cdot(c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n)
\end{equation*}
Recognize the right hand side as a linear combination of linear
combinations of vectors from~$S$.
Thus $\vec{w}\in\spanof{S}$.
%</pf:AddVecSpanNoGrowIffVecInSpan1>
\end{proof}

The discussion at the section's opening involved removing vectors instead of
adding them. 

\begin{corollary}  \label{cor:OmitVecNotShrinkSpanIffVecIsDep}
%<*cor:OmitVecNotShrinkSpanIffVecIsDep>
For $\vec{v}\in S$,
omitting that vector does not shrink the span
$\spanof{S}=\spanof{S-\set{\vec{v}}}$
if and only if it is dependent on other vectors in the 
set,~$\vec{v}\in\spanof{S}$. 
%</cor:OmitVecNotShrinkSpanIffVecIsDep>
\end{corollary}

The corollary says that to know whether removing a vector will decrease
the span, we need to know whether the vector is a linear combination
of others in the set.

\begin{definition}\label{def:LinInd}
%<*df:LinInd>
In any vector space, a set of vectors is
\definend{linearly independent}\index{linearly independent}%
\index{sets!dependent, independent}
if none of its elements is a linear combination of the 
others from the set.\footnote{See also \nearbyremark{rem:WhyLIUsesMultiset}.}\spacefactor=1000\ 
Otherwise the set is 
\definend{linearly dependent}\index{linearly dependent}.
%</df:LinInd>
\end{definition}
% A multiset subset of a vector space is
% \definend{linearly independent}\index{linearly independent}%
% \index{sets!dependent, independent}
% if none of its elements is a linear combination of the 
% others.\footnote{More information on multisets is in the appendix. 
% Most of the time we won't need the 
% set-multiset distinction and we will
% follow the standard terminology of referring to a linearly independent or 
% dependent `set'.
% \nearbyremark{rem:WhyLIUsesMultiset} explains why 
% the definition requires a multiset.}\spacefactor=1000\ 
% Otherwise it is \definend{linearly dependent}\index{linearly dependent}.

Thus the set $\set{\vec{s}_0,\ldots,\vec{s}_n}$ is independent
if there is no equality
$\vec{s}_i=c_0\vec{s}_0+\ldots+c_{i-1}\vec{s}_{i-1}+c_{i+1}\vec{s}_{i+1}+\ldots+c_n\vec{s}_n$.
The definition's use of the word `others' means that
writing $\vec{s}_i$ as a linear combination via $\vec{s}_i=1\cdot\vec{s}_i$ 
does not count.

%<*LinInd>
Observe that, 
although this way of writing one vector as a combination of the others
\begin{equation*}
   \vec{s}_0=\lincombo{c}{\vec{s}}
\end{equation*}
visually sets off \( \vec{s}_0 \), algebraically
there is nothing special about that vector in that equation.
For any \( \vec{s}_i \) with a coefficient $c_i$ that is non-$0$,
we can rewrite to isolate \( \vec{s}_i \).
\begin{equation*}
   \vec{s}_i=(1/c_i)\vec{s}_0+\dots
              +(-c_{i-1}/c_i)\vec{s}_{i-1}+(-c_{i+1}/c_i)\vec{s}_{i+1}
              +\dots+(-c_n/c_i)\vec{s}_n
\end{equation*}
When we don't want to single out any vector
we will instead say that
\( \vec{s}_0,\vec{s}_1,\dots,\vec{s}_n \) are in a
\definend{linear relationship}\index{linear relationship}%
\index{relationship!linear} 
and put all of the vectors on the same side.
%</LinInd>
The next result rephrases the linear independence definition in this style.
It is how we usually compute whether
a finite set is dependent or independent.

\begin{lemma}   \label{le:LDIffANonTrivLinRel}
%<*lm:LDIffANonTrivLinRel>
A subset \( S \) of a vector space is linearly independent if and only if 
among its elements  
the only linear relationship 
$ c_1\vec{s}_1+\dots+c_n\vec{s}_n=\zero$
is the trivial one, \( c_1=0,\dots,\,c_n=0 \)
(where $\vec{s}_i\neq\vec{s}_j$ when $i\neq j$) .
%</lm:LDIffANonTrivLinRel>
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
%<*pf:LDIffANonTrivLinRel>
If \( S \) is linearly independent then no vector
$\vec{s}_i$ 
is a linear combination of other vectors from $S$,
so there is no linear relationship where some of the
$\vec{s}\,$'s have nonzero coefficients.

If \( S \) is not linearly independent then some \( \vec{s}_i \) is a linear
combination 
$\vec{s}_i=c_1\vec{s}_1+\dots+c_{i-1}\vec{s}_{i-1}
    +c_{i+1}\vec{s}_{i+1}+\dots+c_n\vec{s}_n$
of other vectors from \( S \). 
Subtracting $\vec{s}_i$ from both sides
gives a relationship
involving a nonzero coefficient,
the \( -1 \) in front of \( \vec{s}_i \).
%</pf:LDIffANonTrivLinRel>
\end{proof}

\begin{example}  \label{ex:StaticsLI}
In the vector space of two-wide row vectors, the two-element set
\( \set{ \rowvec{40 &15},\rowvec{-50 &25}} \) is linearly independent.
To check this, take
\begin{equation*}
  c_1\cdot\rowvec{40 &15}+c_2\cdot\rowvec{-50 &25}=\rowvec{0 &0}
\end{equation*}
and solve the resulting system.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{linsys}{2}
    40c_1  &-  &50c_2  &=  &0  \\
    15c_1  &+  &25c_2  &=  &0  
   \end{linsys}
  \grstep{-(15/40)\rho_1+\rho_2}
  \begin{linsys}{2}
     40c_1  &- &50c_2       &=  &0  \\
            &  &(175/4)c_2  &=  &0  
   \end{linsys}
\end{equation*}
Both \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are zero. 
So the only linear relationship between the two given row vectors
is the trivial relationship.

In the same vector space, the set
\( \set{ \rowvec{40 &15},\rowvec{20 &7.5}} \) is linearly dependent since
we can satisfy
% \begin{equation*}
$c_1\cdot \rowvec{40 &15}+c_2\cdot\rowvec{20 &7.5}=\rowvec{0 &0}$
% \end{equation*}
with \( c_1=1 \) and \( c_2=-2 \).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The set \( \set{1+x,1-x} \) is linearly independent in \( \polyspace_2 \), the
space of quadratic polynomials with real coefficients, because
\begin{equation*}
   0+0x+0x^2
   =
   c_1(1+x)+c_2(1-x)
   =
   (c_1+c_2)+(c_1-c_2)x+0x^2
\end{equation*}
gives 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{linsys}{2}
    c_1  &+  &c_2  &=  &0  \\
    c_1  &-  &c_2  &=  &0  
   \end{linsys}
  \grstep{-\rho_1+\rho_2}
  \begin{linsys}{2}
     c_1  &+  &c_2  &=  &0  \\
          &   &2c_2 &=  &0
  \end{linsys}
\end{equation*}
since polynomials are equal only if their coefficients are equal.
Thus, the only linear relationship between these two members of
$\polyspace_2$ is the trivial one.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
The lemma specifies that $\vec{s}_i\neq\vec{s}_j$ 
when $i\neq j$ because of course if some vector~$\vec{s}$ appears 
twice then we can get a nontrivial
$c_1\vec{s}_1+\dots+c_n\vec{s}_n=\zero$, by taking
the associated coefficients to be $1$ and~$-1$.
Besides, if some vector appears more than once in an expression then
we can always combine the coefficients.

Note that the lemma allows the 
opposite of appearing more than once, that some 
vectors from~$S$ don't appear at all.
For instance, if~$S$ is infinite then because
linear relationships involve only finitely many vectors, 
any such relationship leaves out many of $S$'s vectors.
However, note also that if~$S$ is finite then where convenient
we can take a combination
$c_1\vec{s}_1+\dots+c_n\vec{s}_n$ to contain each of $S$'s vectors once and
only once.
If a vector is missing then we can add it by using a 
coefficient of~$0$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
The rows of this matrix
\begin{equation*}
  A=
  \begin{mat}[r]
    2  &3  &1  &0  \\
    0  &-1 &0  &-2 \\
    0  &0  &0  &1
  \end{mat}
\end{equation*}
form a linearly independent set.
This is easy to check for this case but also 
recall that Lemma~One.III.\ref{le:EchFormNoLinCombo}
shows that the rows of any echelon form matrix make
a linearly independent set.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
In \( \Re^3 \), where
\begin{equation*}
   \vec{v}_1=\colvec{3 \\ 4 \\ 5}
   \quad
   \vec{v}_2=\colvec{2 \\ 9 \\ 2}
   \quad
   \vec{v}_3=\colvec{4 \\ 18 \\ 4}
\end{equation*}
the set \( S=\set{\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\vec{v}_3} \)
is linearly dependent because this is a relationship
\begin{equation*}
  0\cdot\vec{v}_1
  +2\cdot\vec{v}_2
  -1\cdot\vec{v}_3
  =\zero
\end{equation*}
where not all of the scalars are zero 
(the fact that some 
of the scalars are zero doesn't matter).
\end{example}

% \begin{remark}  \label{rem:WhyLIIsNonTrivLinRel}
That example illustrates why, 
although \nearbydefinition{def:LinInd} is a clearer
statement of what independence means,
\nearbylemma{le:LDIffANonTrivLinRel} is better for
computations.
Working straight from the definition, someone trying to compute whether $S$
is linearly independent would start by setting
\( \vec{v}_1=c_2\vec{v}_2+c_3\vec{v}_3 \)
and concluding that there are no such $c_2$ and $c_3$.
But knowing that the first vector is not
dependent on the other two is not enough.
This person would have to go on to try
\( \vec{v}_2=c_1\vec{v}_1+c_3\vec{v}_3 \), in order  
to find the dependence $c_1=0$, \( c_3=1/2 \).
\nearbylemma{le:LDIffANonTrivLinRel} 
gets the same conclusion with only one computation.
% \end{remark}

\begin{example} \label{ex:EmSetLI}
The empty subset\index{sets!empty} of a vector space is linearly independent.
There is no nontrivial linear relationship among its members as it has
no members.
\end{example}

\begin{example} \label{ex:SetWithZeroVecLD}
In any vector space, any subset containing the zero vector is linearly 
dependent.
One example is, in the space $\polyspace_2$ of quadratic polynomials, 
the subset $\set{1+x,x+x^2,0}$.
It is linearly 
dependent because 
$0\cdot\vec{v}_1+0\cdot\vec{v}_2+1\cdot\zero=\zero$ is a nontrivial
relationship, since not all of the coefficients are zero.
\end{example}

There is a subtle point that we shall see a number of times and that
bears on the prior example.
It is about the trivial sum, the sum of the empty set.
One way to see how to define the trivial sum 
is to consider the progression
$\vec{v}_1+\vec{v}_2+\vec{v}_3$, followed by
$\vec{v}_1+\vec{v}_2$, followed by
$\vec{v}_1$.
The difference between the sum of three vectors and the sum of two 
is $\vec{v}_3$.
Then the difference between the sum of two and the sum of one 
is $\vec{v}_2$.
In next passing to the trivial sum, the sum of zero-many vectors, 
we can expect to subtract~$\vec{v}_1$.
So we define the sum of zero-many vectors to be the zero vector. 

The relation with the prior example is that if the zero vector is in a set
then that set has an element that
is a combination of a subset of other vectors from the set, specifically,
the zero vector is a combination of the empty subset.
Even the set $S=\set{\zero}$ is linearly dependent, because $\zero$ is the 
sum of the empty set and the empty set is a subset of~$S$. 

\begin{remark} \label{rem:WhyLIUsesMultiset} %\cite{Velleman} 
The definition of linear independence,
\nearbydefinition{def:LinInd}, refers to a `set' of vectors.
Sets are the most familiar kind of collection and
in practice everyone uses the word `set' in this context.
But to be complete, we will note that sets are not quite the right kind
of collection for this purpose.

Recall that a set is a collection with two properties: 
(i)~order does not matter,
so that the set $\set{1,2}$ equals the set $\set{2,1}$, and 
(ii)~duplicates collapse, so that the set $\set{1,1,2}$ equals the set
$\set{1,2}$.

Now consider this matrix reduction.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{mat}
    1 &1 &1 \\
    2 &2 &2 \\
    1 &2 &3
  \end{mat}
  \grstep{(1/2)\rho_2}
  \begin{mat}
    1 &1 &1 \\
    1 &1 &1 \\
    1 &2 &3
  \end{mat}
\end{equation*}
On the left the set of matrix rows 
$\set{\rowvec{1 &1 &1}, \rowvec{2 &2 &2}, \rowvec{1 &2 &3}}$ is
linearly dependent.
On the right the set of rows is  
$\set{\rowvec{1 &1 &1}, \rowvec{1 &1 &1}, \rowvec{1 &2 &3}}$. 
Because duplicates collapse, that equals
the set
$\set{\rowvec{1 &1 &1}, \rowvec{1 &2 &3}}$, 
which is linearly independent.
This is a problem because Gauss's Method should preserve linear dependence.

That is, strictly speaking,
we need a type of collection where duplicates do not collapse.
A collection where order does not matter and duplicates don't collapse
is a \definend{multiset}.\index{sets!multiset}%
\index{multiset}\index{linear independence!multiset}

However, while insisting on being completely correct has advantages,
departing from the standard terminology of `set' would have pitfalls of its 
own, so we will continue to use that word.
Later, we shall occasionally need to take combinations without
letting duplicates collapse and we shall do that without 
further comment.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:LiSetMinSpanSet}
%<*cor:LiSetMinSpanSet>
A set $S$ is linearly independent if and only if
for any $\vec{v}\in S$, its removal shrinks the span
$\spanof{S-\set{v}}\subsetneq\spanof{S}$.
%</cor:LiSetMinSpanSet>
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
%<*pf:LiSetMinSpanSet>
This follows from \nearbycorollary{cor:OmitVecNotShrinkSpanIffVecIsDep}.
If $S$ is linearly independent then none of its vectors is dependent on 
the other elements, so removal of any vector will shrink the span.
If $S$ is not linearly independent then it contains a vector that is 
dependent on other elements of the set, and removal of that vector
will not shrink the span.
%</pf:LiSetMinSpanSet>
\end{proof}

So a spanning set is minimal if and only if it is linearly independent.

The prior result addresses removing elements from a linearly independent set.
The next one adds elements.

\begin{lemma}  \label{lm:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan}
%<*lm:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan>
Suppose that $S$ is linearly independent and that $\vec{v}\notin S$.
Then
the set $S\union\set{\vec{v}}$ is linearly independent if and only if 
$\vec{v}\notin\spanof{S}$.   
%</lm:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan>
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
%<*pf:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan0>
% Assume that $S$ is linearly independent and that $\vec{v}\notin S$.
We will show that $S\union\set{\vec{v}}$ is not linearly independent 
if and only if $\vec{v}\in\spanof{S}$.

Suppose first that $\vec{v}\in\spanof{S}$.
Express $\vec{v}$ as a combination $\vec{v}=c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n$.
Rewrite that $\zero=c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n-1\cdot\vec{v}$.
Since $\vec{v}\notin S$, it does not equal any of the $\vec{s}_i$ so this is 
a nontrivial linear dependence among the elements of $S\union\set{\vec{v}}$.
Thus that set is not linearly independent.
%</pf:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan0>

%<*pf:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan1>
Now suppose that $S\union\set{\vec{v}}$ is not linearly independent and
consider a nontrivial dependence among its members
$\zero=c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n+c_{n+1}\cdot\vec{v}$.
If $c_{n+1}=0$ then that is a dependence among the elements of~$S$, but 
we are assuming that~$S$ is independent, so $c_{n+1}\neq 0$.
Rewrite the equation  
as $\vec{v}=(c_1/c_{n+1})\vec{s}_1+\cdots+(c_n/c_{n+1})\vec{s}_n$
to get $\vec{v}\in\spanof{S}$
%</pf:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan1>
\end{proof}



\begin{example} \label{ex:LinindSetsAndSuper}
This subset of $\Re^3$ is linearly independent.
\begin{equation*}
  S
   =\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 0}}
\end{equation*}
The span of $S$ is the $x$-axis.
Here are two supersets, one that is linearly dependent and the other
independent.
\begin{center}
     dependent:
     \( \set{
         \colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
         \colvec{-3 \\ 0 \\ 0}} \)      
     \qquad
     independent:
     \( \set{
         \colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
         \colvec{0 \\ 1 \\ 0}} \)      
\end{center}
We got the
dependent superset by adding a vector from the $x$-axis
and so the span did not grow.
We got the independent superset by adding a vector 
that isn't in $\spanof{S}$, because it has a nonzero $y$~component,
causing the span to grow.

For the independent set
\begin{equation*}
  S
   =\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
          \colvec{0 \\ 1 \\ 0}
                 }
\end{equation*}
the span \( \spanof{S} \) is the \( xy \)-plane.
Here are two supersets.
\begin{center}
     dependent:
     \( \set{
         \colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
         \colvec{0 \\ 1 \\ 0},
         \colvec{3 \\ -2 \\ 0} } \)       
     \qquad
     independent:
     \( \set{
         \colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
         \colvec{0 \\ 1 \\ 0},
         \colvec{0 \\ 0 \\ 1} } \)    
\end{center}
As above, the additional member of the 
dependent superset comes from $\spanof{S}$, the $xy$-plane, while the 
added member of the
independent superset comes from outside of that span.

Finally, consider this independent set 
\begin{equation*}
   S =\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
          \colvec{0 \\ 1 \\ 0},
          \colvec{0 \\ 0 \\ 1}        } 
\end{equation*}
with \( \spanof{S}=\Re^3 \).  
We can get a linearly dependent superset.
\begin{center}
     dependent:
     \( \set{
         \colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
         \colvec{0 \\ 1 \\ 0},
         \colvec{0 \\ 0 \\ 1},
         \colvec{2 \\ -1 \\ 3} } \)     
\end{center}
But there is no linearly independent superset of $S$.
One way to see that is to note that
for any vector that we would add to $S$, the equation

   +c_3\colvec{0 \\ 0 \\ 1}
\end{equation*}
has a solution $c_1=x$, $c_2=y$, and $c_3=z$.
Another way to see it is that
we cannot add any vectors from outside of the span $\spanof{S}$ because that
span is $\Re^3$.
\end{example}

\begin{corollary} \label{th:AlwaysAnLDSubset}
%<*th:AlwaysAnLDSubset>
In a vector space,
any finite set has a linearly independent subset with the same span.
%</th:AlwaysAnLDSubset>
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
%<*pf:AlwaysAnLDSubset0>
If \( S=\set{ \vec{s}_1,\dots,\vec{s}_n} \) is linearly independent
then $S$ itself satisfies the statement, so 
assume that it is linearly dependent.
%</pf:AlwaysAnLDSubset0>

%<*pf:AlwaysAnLDSubset1>
By the definition of dependent, $S$ contains
a vector $\vec{v}_1$ that is a linear combination of
the others.
Define the set \( S_1=S-\set{\vec{v}_1} \).
By \nearbycorollary{cor:OmitVecNotShrinkSpanIffVecIsDep} % {lm:ShrinkSpanByRemovingNonRepeat} 
the span does not shrink \( \spanof{S_1}=\spanof{S} \).
%</pf:AlwaysAnLDSubset1>

%<*pf:AlwaysAnLDSubset2>
If \( S_1 \) is linearly independent then we are done.
Otherwise iterate: 
take a vector $\vec{v}_2$ 
that is a linear combination of
other members of $S_1$ and discard it
to derive \( S_2=S_1-\set{\vec{v}_2} \)
such that \( \spanof{S_2}=\spanof{S_1} \).
Repeat this until a linearly independent set $S_j$ appears;
one must appear eventually because \( S \) is finite
and the empty set is linearly independent.
%</pf:AlwaysAnLDSubset2>
(Formally, this argument uses
induction on the number of elements in $S$.
\nearbyexercise{exer:FillIndDetProofSetHasLISub} asks for the details.)
\end{proof}

Thus if we have a set that is linearly dependent then we can, without changing
the span, pare down by   
discarding what we have called ``repeat'' vectors.

\begin{example}  \label{ex:ShrinkSetSameSpan}
This set spans \( \Re^3 \) (the check is routine)
but is not linearly independent. 
\begin{equation*}
  S=\set{\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
     \colvec[r]{0 \\ 2 \\ 0},
     \colvec[r]{1 \\ 2 \\ 0},
     \colvec[r]{0 \\ -1 \\ 1},
     \colvec[r]{3 \\ 3 \\ 0}  }
\end{equation*}
We will calculate which vectors to drop in order
to get a subset that is independent but
has the same span.
This linear relationship
\begin{equation*}
  c_1\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 0}
  +c_2\colvec[r]{0 \\ 2 \\ 0}
  +c_3\colvec[r]{1 \\ 2 \\ 0}
  +c_4\colvec[r]{0 \\ -1 \\ 1}
  +c_5\colvec[r]{3 \\ 3 \\ 0}
  =\colvec[r]{0 \\ 0 \\ 0}
  \qquad\tag{$*$}
\end{equation*}
gives a system 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{linsys}{5}
     c_1  &   &      &+  &c_3   &+  &    &+  &3c_5 &= &0  \\
          &   &2c_2  &+  &2c_3  &-  &c_4 &+  &3c_5 &= &0  \\
          &   &      &   &     &   &c_4  &   &     &= &0  
\end{linsys}
\end{equation*}
whose solution set has this parametrization.
\begin{equation*}
  \set{\colvec{c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3 \\ c_4 \\ c_5}=
     c_3\colvec[r]{-1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0}
     +c_5\colvec[r]{-3 \\ -3/2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1}
     \suchthat c_3,c_5\in\Re }
\end{equation*}
Set $c_5=1$ and~$c_3=0$ 
to get an instance of ($*$).
\begin{equation*}
  -3\cdot\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 0}
  -\frac{3}{2}\cdot\colvec[r]{0 \\ 2 \\ 0}
  +0\cdot\colvec[r]{1 \\ 2 \\ 0}
  +0\cdot\colvec[r]{0 \\ -1 \\ 1}
  +1\cdot\colvec[r]{3 \\ 3 \\ 0}
  =\colvec[r]{0 \\ 0 \\ 0}
\end{equation*}
This shows that the vector from $S$ that we've 
associated with~$c_5$
is in the span of the set of $c_1$'s vector and $c_2$'s vector.
We can discard $S$'s fifth vector without shrinking the span.

Similarly, set $c_3=1$, and $c_5=0$
to get an instance of~($*$) that
shows we can discard $S$'s third vector without shrinking the span. 
 Thus this set has the same span as $S$.
\begin{equation*}
  % \hat{S}=
     \set{\colvec[r]{1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
     \colvec[r]{0 \\ 2 \\ 0},
     \colvec[r]{0 \\ -1 \\ 1}  }
\end{equation*}
The check that it is linearly independent is routine.
\end{example}

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:LDMeansLC}
%<*co:LDMeansLC>
A subset \( S=\set{\vec{s}_1,\dots,\vec{s}_n} \) of a vector space
is linearly dependent if and only if some \( \vec{s_i} \)
is a linear combination of the vectors 
\( \vec{s}_1 \), \ldots, \( \vec{s}_{i-1} \)
listed before it.
%</co:LDMeansLC>
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
%<*pf:LDMeansLC>
Consider \( S_0=\set{} \), \( S_1=\set{\vec{s_1}} \),
\( S_2=\set{\vec{s}_1,\vec{s}_2 } \), etc.
Some index \( i\geq 1 \) is the first one with
\( S_{i-1}\union\set{\vec{s}_i } \)
linearly dependent, and there \( \vec{s}_i\in\spanof{ S_{i-1} } \).
%</pf:LDMeansLC>
\end{proof}

The proof of 
\nearbycorollary{th:AlwaysAnLDSubset} describes producing a linearly 
independent set by shrinking, by taking subsets.
And the proof of \nearbycorollary{cor:LDMeansLC} describes finding a 
linearly dependent set by taking supersets. 
We finish this subsection by considering
how linear independence and dependence interact
with the subset relation between sets.

\begin{lemma}  \label{le:SubsetPreserveLI}
%<*lm:SubsetPreserveLI>
Any subset of a linearly independent set is also linearly independent.
Any superset of a linearly dependent set is also linearly dependent.
%</lm:SubsetPreserveLI>
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
%<*pf:SubsetPreserveLI>
Both are clear.
%</pf:SubsetPreserveLI>
\end{proof}

%<*SubsetPreserveLI>
Restated, subset preserves independence  
and superset preserves dependence.
%</SubsetPreserveLI>

Those are two of the four possible cases.
The third case, whether subset preserves linear dependence,
is covered by \nearbyexample{ex:ShrinkSetSameSpan}, which gives
a linearly dependent set $S$ with one subset 
that is linearly dependent and another 
that is independent.
The fourth case, whether superset preserves linear independence,
is covered by \nearbyexample{ex:LinindSetsAndSuper}, which gives cases
where a linearly independent set has both an independent
and a dependent superset.

\nearbyexample{ex:LinindSetsAndSuper} has something else to say about the
interaction between linear independence and superset.
It names a
linearly independent set that is maximal in
that it has no supersets that are linearly independent.
By \nearbylemma{lm:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan} 
a linearly independent set is maximal if and only if it
spans the 
entire space, because that is when 
all the vectors in the space are already in the span.
This nicely
complements \nearbylemma{cor:LiSetMinSpanSet}, that
a spanning set is minimal if and only if it is linearly independent.

% In summary,
% we have introduced the definition of linear independence to 
% formalize the idea of the minimality of a spanning set.
% We have developed some properties of this idea.
% The most important is \nearbylemma{lm:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan}, which 
% tells us that a linearly independent set is maximal when it spans the space.

          yields a free variable, so there are infinitely many solutions.
          For an example of a particular dependence we can set $c_3$ to be,

          We can get a particular solution by taking $c_3$ to be, say,

          contradictory equation because the system is homogeneous, and so

        \partsitem   The natural vector space is $\Re^3$.
          Set up the equation
          \begin{equation*}
            \colvec{0 \\ 0 \\ 0}=c_1\colvec{1 \\ 2 \\ 0}
                                 +c_2\colvec{-1 \\ 1 \\ 0}
          \end{equation*}
          and consider the resulting homogeneous system.
          \begin{equation*}
             \begin{amat}{2}
               1  &-1 &0  \\
               2  &1  &0  \\
               0  &0  &0
             \end{amat}
             \grstep{-2\rho_1+\rho_2}
             \begin{amat}{2}
              1  &-1 &0  \\
              0  &3  &0  \\
              0  &0  &0
            \end{amat} 
          \end{equation*}
          This has the unique solution, that $c_1=0$, $c_2=0$.
          So it is linearly independent.
        \partsitem   The natural vector space is the set of three-wide 
          row vectors.
          The equation
          \begin{equation*}
            \rowvec{0 &0 &0}=c_1\rowvec{1 &3 &1}
                            +c_2\rowvec{-1 &4 &3}
                            +c_3\rowvec{-1 &11 &7}
          \end{equation*}
          gives rise to a linear system
          \begin{align*}
            \begin{amat}{3}
              1  &-1  &-1  &0  \\
              3  &4   &11  &0  \\
              1  &3   &7   &0
           \end{amat}
           &\grstep[-\rho_1+\rho_3]{-3\rho_1+\rho_2}
           \begin{amat}{3}
             1  &-1  &-1  &0  \\
             0  &7   &14  &0  \\
             0  &4   &8   &0
          \end{amat}                                   \\
          &\grstep{(4/7)\rho_2+\rho_3}
          \begin{amat}{3}
            1  &-1  &-1  &0  \\
            0  &7   &14  &0  \\
            0  &0   &0   &0
         \end{amat}
       \end{align*}
       with infinitely many solutions, that is, more than just the 
       trivial solution.
       \begin{equation*}
         \set{\colvec{c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3}
              =\colvec{-1 \\ -2 \\ 1}c_3
              \suchthat c_3\in\Re}
       \end{equation*}
       So the set is linearly dependent.
       One dependence comes from setting $c_3=2$, giving 
       $c_1=-2$ and $c_2=-4$.
      \partsitem   Without having to set up a system we can see 
        that the second element of the set is a multiple of the first 
        (namely, $0$ times the first).

    \begin{answer}
      In each case, if the set is independent then you must prove that 
      and if it is
      dependent then you must exhibit a dependence.
      \begin{exparts}
        \partsitem This set is dependent.
          The familiar relation $\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1$ shows that
          $2=c_1\cdot(4\sin^2(x))+c_2\cdot(\cos^2(x))$ is satisfied by
          $c_1=1/2$ and $c_2=2$.
        \partsitem This set is independent.
          Consider the relationship
          $c_1\cdot 1+c_2\cdot\sin(x)+c_3\cdot\sin(2x)=0$
          (that `$0$' is the zero function).
          Taking three suitable points such as $x=\pi$, $x=\pi/2$, $x=\pi/4$ 
          gives a system
          \begin{equation*}
            \begin{linsys}{3}
               c_1  &   &                &   &      &=  &0  \\
               c_1  &+  &c_2             &   &      &=  &0  \\
               c_1  &+  &(\sqrt{2}/2)c_2 &+  &c_3   &=  &0  
            \end{linsys}
          \end{equation*}
          whose only solution is 
          $c_1=0$, $c_2=0$, and $c_3=0$. 
        \partsitem By inspection, this set is independent.
          Any dependence $\cos(x)=c\cdot x$ is not possible since the cosine
          function is not a multiple of the identity function
          (we are applying \nearbycorollary{cor:LDMeansLC}).
        \partsitem By inspection, we spot that there is a dependence.
          Because $(1+x)^2=x^2+2x+1$, we get that
          $c_1\cdot(1+x)^2+c_2\cdot(x^2+2x)=3$ is satisfied by 
          $c_1=3$ and $c_2=-3$.
        \partsitem This set is dependent.
          The easiest way to see that is to recall the trigonometric
          relationship $\cos^2(x)-\sin^2(x)=\cos(2x)$.
          (\textit{Remark.} 
          A person who doesn't recall this, and tries some $x$'s,
          simply never gets a system leading to a unique solution, and
          never gets to conclude that the set is independent.
          Of course, this person might wonder if they simply never tried the
          right set of $x$'s, but a few tries will lead most people to 
          look instead for a dependence.)
        \partsitem This set is dependent, because it contains the 
          zero object in the vector space, the zero polynomial.

    \( -\pi/2 \) and \( \pi/2) \)?
    \begin{answer}
      No, that equation is not a linear relationship.

       \begin{exparts}
         \partsitem Assume that 
           \( \set{\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}} \) is linearly 
           independent, so that any relationship
           $d_0\vec{u}+d_1\vec{v}+d_2\vec{w}=\zero$ leads to the conclusion 
           that $d_0=0$, $d_1=0$, and $d_2=0$.

           Consider the relationship
           \( c_1(\vec{u})+c_2(\vec{u}+\vec{v})+c_3(\vec{u}+\vec{v}+\vec{w})

           \( (c_1+c_2+c_3)\vec{u}+(c_2+c_3)\vec{v}+(c_3)\vec{w}=\zero \).
           Taking $d_0$ to be $c_1+c_2+c_3$, taking $d_1$ to be $c_2+c_3$, 
           and taking $d_2$ to be $c_3$ we have this system.

        \partsitem A singleton set $\set{\vec{v}}$ is linearly independent 
          if and only if $\vec{v}\neq\zero$.
          For the `if' direction, with $\vec{v}\neq\zero$, 
          we can apply \nearbylemma{le:LDIffANonTrivLinRel} by considering 
          the relationship
          \( c\cdot\vec{v}=\zero \) and noting that the only solution
          is the trivial one:~$c=0$.
          For the `only~if' direction, just recall that 
          \nearbyexample{ex:SetWithZeroVecLD}
          shows that $\set{\zero}$ is linearly dependent, and so if the set
          $\set{\vec{v}}$ is linearly independent then $\vec{v}\neq\zero$. 

          (\textit{Remark.} 
          Another answer is to say that this is the special case of
          \nearbylemma{lm:AddVecLiSetIsLiIffVecNotInSpan}

          This is an equivalent statement:~a set is linearly dependent if and
          only if one element is a multiple of the other.

          (where the vectors are members of $S$).
          Now, 
          \begin{equation*}
            c_1\vec{s}_1+\dots+c_n\vec{s}_n
            =\vec{v}
            =d_1\vec{t}_1+\dots+d_m\vec{t}_m
          \end{equation*}
          can be rewritten in this way.
          \begin{equation*}
            c_1\vec{s}_1+\dots+c_n\vec{s}_n
            -d_1\vec{t}_1-\dots-d_m\vec{t}_m
            =\zero
          \end{equation*}
          Possibly some of the $\vec{s}\,$'s equal some of the $\vec{t}\,$'s;
          we can combine the associated coefficients 
          (i.e., if $\vec{s}_i=\vec{t}_j$ then
          $\cdots+c_i\vec{s}_i+\dots-d_j\vec{t}_j-\cdots$ can be rewritten
          as $\cdots+(c_i-d_j)\vec{s}_i+\cdots$).
          That equation is a linear relationship among  
          distinct (after the combining is done) members of the set $S$.
          We've assumed that $S$ is linearly independent, so all of the 
          coefficients are zero.
          If $i$ is such that $\vec{s}_i$ does not equal any $\vec{t}_j$
          then $c_i$ is zero.
          If $j$ is such that $\vec{t}_j$ does not equal any $\vec{s}_i$
          then $d_j$ is zero.
          In the final case, we have that $c_i-d_j=0$ and so $c_i=d_j$.  

          Therefore, the original two sums are the same, except perhaps for
          some $0\cdot\vec{s}_i$ or $0\cdot\vec{t}_j$ terms that we can
          neglect.
        \partsitem
          This set is not linearly independent:
          \begin{equation*}
            S=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0},\colvec{2 \\ 0}}\subset\Re^2
          \end{equation*}
          and these two linear combinations give the same result
          \begin{equation*}
            \colvec{0 \\ 0}=2\cdot\colvec{1 \\ 0}-1\cdot\colvec{2 \\ 0}
                            =4\cdot\colvec{1 \\ 0}-2\cdot\colvec{2 \\ 0}
          \end{equation*}
          Thus, a linearly dependent set might have indistinct sums.

          In fact, this stronger statement holds:~if a set is linearly 
          dependent then it must have the property that there are two 
          distinct linear combinations that sum to the same vector.
          Briefly, where \( c_1\vec{s}_1+\dots+c_n\vec{s}_n=\zero \) then
          multiplying both sides of the relationship by two gives another 
          relationship.
          If the first relationship is nontrivial then the second is also.

  \item  \label{exer:PolyZeroFcnOnlyIfZeroPol}
     Prove that a polynomial gives rise to the zero function if and only if
     it is the zero polynomial.
     (\textit{Comment.}
     This question is not a Linear Algebra matter but we often use the result.
     A polynomial gives rise to a function in the natural 
     way:~$x\mapsto c_nx^n+\dots+c_1x+c_0$.)
     \begin{answer}
       In this `if and only if' statement, the `if' half is clear\Dash if 
       the polynomial is the zero polynomial then the function that arises 
       from the action of the polynomial must be the zero 
       function $x\mapsto 0$. 
       For `only if' we write $p(x)=c_nx^n+\dots+c_0$. 
       Plugging in zero $p(0)=0$ gives that $c_0=0$.
       Taking the derivative and plugging in zero $p^\prime(0)=0$ gives 
       that $c_1=0$.
       Similarly we get that each $c_i$ is zero, and $p$ is the zero 
       polynomial.

      \partsitem Any set five vectors is a superset of a set of four vectors,

  \item  
    In \( \Re^4 \) what is the biggest linearly independent
    set you can find?
    The smallest?
    The biggest linearly dependent set?
    The smallest?
    (`Biggest' and `smallest' mean that there are no supersets or subsets 
    with the same property.)
    \begin{answer} 
      In \( \Re^4 \) the biggest linearly independent set has
      four vectors.
      There are many examples of such sets, this is one.
      \begin{equation*}
        \set{\colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0},
             \colvec{0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0},
             \colvec{0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0},
             \colvec{0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1}  }
      \end{equation*}
      To see that no set with five or more vectors can be independent, set up
      \begin{equation*}
             c_1\colvec{a_{1,1} \\ a_{2,1} \\ a_{3,1} \\ a_{4,1}}
            +c_2\colvec{a_{1,2} \\ a_{2,2} \\ a_{3,2} \\ a_{4,2}}
            +c_3\colvec{a_{1,3} \\ a_{2,3} \\ a_{3,3} \\ a_{4,3}}
            +c_4\colvec{a_{1,4} \\ a_{2,4} \\ a_{3,4} \\ a_{4,4}}
            +c_5\colvec{a_{1,5} \\ a_{2,5} \\ a_{3,5} \\ a_{4,5}}
             =\colvec{0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0}
      \end{equation*}
      and note that the resulting linear system 
      \begin{equation*}
        \begin{linsys}{5}
          a_{1,1}c_1 &+ &a_{1,2}c_2 &+ &a_{1,3}c_3

          a_{2,1}c_1 &+ &a_{2,2}c_2 &+ &a_{2,3}c_3 
              &+ &a_{2,4}c_4 &+ &a_{2,5}c_5 &=  &0   \\

              &+ &a_{3,4}c_4 &+ &a_{3,5}c_5 &=  &0   \\
          a_{4,1}c_1 &+ &a_{4,2}c_2 &+ &a_{4,3}c_3 
              &+ &a_{4,4}c_4 &+ &a_{4,5}c_5 &=  &0     
        \end{linsys}
      \end{equation*}
      has four equations and five unknowns, 
      so Gauss's Method must end with at least one \( c \) variable free,
      so there are infinitely many solutions,
      and so the above linear relationship among the four-tall vectors has
      more solutions than just the trivial solution.

      The smallest linearly independent set is the empty set.

      The biggest linearly dependent set is \( \Re^4 \).
      The smallest is \( \set{\zero} \).

  \recommended \item 
    Linear independence and linear dependence are properties of sets.
    We can thus naturally ask how the properties of linear independence
    and dependence act with respect to
    the familiar elementary set relations and operations.  
    In this body of this subsection we have covered the subset and superset
    relations.
    We can also consider the operations of intersection, complementation, 
    and union.

       \partsitem How does linear independence relate to intersection:~can
         an intersection of linearly independent sets be independent?

       \partsitem Show that the union of two linearly independent sets
          can be linearly independent.

          the union of two linearly independent sets need not be
          linearly independent.

    \begin{answer}
      \begin{exparts}
        \partsitem The intersection of two linearly independent sets
          $S\intersection T$ must be linearly
          independent as it is a subset of the linearly independent set $S$
          (as well as the linearly independent set $T$ also, of course).
        \partsitem The complement of a linearly independent set is linearly
          dependent as it contains the zero vector.
        \partsitem A simple example in \( \Re^2 \) is these two sets.

            T=\set{\colvec{0 \\ 1}}          
          \end{equation*}
          A somewhat subtler example, again in \( \Re^2 \), is these two.
          \begin{equation*}
            S=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0}}
            \qquad
            T=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0}, \colvec{0 \\ 1}}
          \end{equation*}
        \partsitem We must produce an example.
          One, in \( \Re^2 \), is
          \begin{equation*}
            S=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0}}
            \qquad
            T=\set{\colvec{2 \\ 0}}
          \end{equation*}
          since the linear dependence of \( S_1\union S_2 \) is easy to see.

  \item \textit{Continued from prior exercise.} 
    What is the interaction between the property of linear independence
    and the operation of union?
    \begin{exparts}
       \partsitem We might conjecture that the union $S\union T$ of 
          linearly independent sets 
          is linearly independent if and only if their spans have a trivial 
          intersection $\spanof{S}\intersection \spanof{T}=\set{\zero}$.
          What is wrong with this argument for the `if' direction
          of that conjecture? 
          ``If the union $S\union T$ is linearly independent then
          the only solution to          
          $c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n
            +d_1\vec{t}_1+\cdots+d_m\vec{t}_m
            =\zero$
          is the trivial one $c_1=0$, \ldots, $d_m=0$. 
          So any member of the intersection of the spans
          must be the zero vector because in 
          $c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n
            =d_1\vec{t}_1+\cdots+d_m\vec{t}_m$
          each scalar is zero.''

          \end{equation*}
        \partsitem 
          An example from \( \Re^2 \) is these sets.
          \begin{equation*}
            S=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0}, \colvec{0 \\ 1}}
            \qquad
            T=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0}, \colvec{1 \\ 1}}
          \end{equation*}
        \partsitem The union of two linearly independent sets $S\union T$
          is linearly independent if and only if their spans of \( S \) 
          and \( T-(S\cap T)\) have a trivial intersection 
          $\spanof{S}\intersection \spanof{T-(S\cap T)}=\set{\zero}$.
          To prove that, assume that \( S \) and \( T \) are linearly 
          independent subsets of some vector space.

          For the `only if' direction, assume that the intersection of
          the spans is trivial 
          \( \spanof{S}\intersection \spanof{T-(S\cap T)}=\set{\zero} \).
          Consider the set $S\union (T-(S\cap T))=S\union T$ and
          consider the linear relationship 
          $c_1\vec{s}_1+\dots+c_n\vec{s}_n
            +d_1\vec{t}_1+\dots+d_m\vec{t}_m=\zero$.
          Subtracting gives
          $c_1\vec{s}_1+\dots+c_n\vec{s}_n=
            -d_1\vec{t}_1-\dots-d_m\vec{t}_m$.
          The left side of that equation sums to a vector in $\spanof{S}$, and
          the right side is a vector in $\spanof{T-(S\cap T)}$.
          Therefore, since the intersection of the spans is trivial, both
          sides equal the zero vector.
          Because $S$ is linearly independent, all of the $c$'s are zero.
          Because $T$ is linearly independent so also is  
          $T-(S\cap T)$ linearly independent, 
          and therefore all of the $d$'s are zero.
          Thus, the original linear relationship among members of 
          $S\union T$ only holds if all of the coefficients are zero.
          Hence, $S\union T$ is linearly independent.

          For the `if' half we can make the same argument in reverse.
          Suppose that the union $S\union T$ is linearly independent.
          Consider a linear relationship among members of 
          $S$ and $T-(S\cap T)$.        
          $c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n
            +d_1\vec{t}_1+\cdots+d_m\vec{t}_m
            =\zero$
          Note that no $\vec{s}_i$ is equal to a $\vec{t}_j$
          so that is a combination of distinct vectors, as required by 
          \nearbylemma{le:LDIffANonTrivLinRel}.
          So the only solution 
          is the trivial one $c_1=0$, \ldots, $d_m=0$. 
          Since any vector $\vec{v}$ 
          in the intersection of the spans
          $\spanof{S}\intersection \spanof{T-(S\cap T)}$ 
          we can write 
          $\vec{v}=c_1\vec{s}_1+\cdots+c_n\vec{s}_n
            =-d_1\vec{t}_1-\cdots-d_m\vec{t}_m$,
          and it must be the zero vector because each scalar is zero.

           \( S \).

           The base case is that $S$ has no elements.
           In this case $S$ is linearly independent and there is nothing to 
           check\Dash a subset of $S$ that has the same span as $S$ is $S$

           If the $k+1$-element set \( S=\set{\vec{s}_0,\dots,\vec{s}_{k}} \) 
           is linearly independent then the theorem is trivial,
           so assume that it is dependent.
           By \nearbycorollary{cor:LDMeansLC} there is an \( \vec{s}_i \)
           that is a linear combination of other vectors in \( S \).
           Define \( S_1=S-\set{\vec{s}_i} \) and note that 
           \( S_1 \) has the same span as \( S \) by
           \nearbycorollary{cor:OmitVecNotShrinkSpanIffVecIsDep}.
           The set \( S_1 \) has \( k \) elements and 
           so the inductive hypothesis
           applies to give that it has a linearly independent subset with the 
           same span.
           That subset of \( S_1 \) is the desired subset of \( S \).
         \partsitem Here is a sketch of the argument.
           We have left out the induction argument details.

           If the finite set \( S \) is empty then there is nothing to prove.
           If \( S=\set{\zero} \) then the empty subset will do.

           Otherwise, take some nonzero vector \( \vec{s}_1\in S \)
           and define \( S_1=\set{\vec{s}_1} \).
           If \( \spanof{S_1}=\spanof{S} \) then
           we are finished with this proof by noting that \( S_1 \) is linearly
           independent.

           If not, then there is a nonzero
           vector \( \vec{s}_2\in S-\spanof{S_1} \)
           (if every \( \vec{s}\in S \) is in \( \spanof{S_1} \) then
           \( \spanof{S_1}=\spanof{S} \)).
           Define \( S_2=S_1\union\set{\vec{s}_2} \).
           If \( \spanof{S_2}=\spanof{S} \) then 
           we are finished 
           by using \nearbytheorem{cor:LDMeansLC}
           to show that \( S_2 \) is linearly independent.

           Repeat the last paragraph until a set with a big enough
           span appears.
           That must eventually happen
           because \( S \) is finite, and
           \( \spanof{S} \) will be reached at worst when we have
           used every vector from
           \( S \).

  \item 
     With a some calculation we can get formulas to determine whether or
     not a set of vectors is linearly independent.

       \partsitem Show that this subset of \( \Re^2 \)
         \begin{equation*}
           \set{\colvec{a \\ c},\colvec{b \\ d}}
         \end{equation*}
         is linearly independent if and only if \( ad-bc\neq 0 \).
       \partsitem Show that this subset of \( \Re^3 \)
         \begin{equation*}
           \set{\colvec{a \\ d \\ g},

                \colvec{c \\ f \\ i}  }
         \end{equation*}
         is linearly independent iff
         \( aei+bfg+cdh-hfa-idb-gec \neq 0 \).
       \partsitem When is this subset of \( \Re^3 \)

         \end{equation*}
         linearly independent?
       \partsitem This is an opinion question:~for
         a set of four vectors from \( \Re^4 \),
         must there be a formula involving the sixteen entries 
         that determines independence of the set?
         (You needn't produce such a formula, just decide if one exists.)
    \end{exparts}
    \begin{answer}
      \begin{exparts}
        \partsitem 
          Assuming first that \( a\neq 0 \),
          \begin{equation*}
            x\colvec{a \\ c}
            +y\colvec{b \\ d}
            =\colvec{0 \\ 0}
          \end{equation*}
          gives
          \begin{equation*}

             \end{linsys}
          \end{equation*}
          which has a solution if and only if
          \( 0\neq-(c/a)b+d=(-cb+ad)/d \)
          (we've assumed in this case that \( a\neq 0 \), and so 
          back substitution yields a unique solution).

          The \( a=0 \) case is also not hard\Dash break it into the 
          \( c\neq 0 \) and \( c=0 \) subcases and 
          note that in these cases \( ad-bc=0\cdot d-bc \).

          \textit{Comment.}
          An earlier exercise showed that a two-vector set is linearly
          dependent if and only if either vector is a scalar multiple of the
          other.
          We could also use that to make the calculation.
        \partsitem The equation
          \begin{equation*}
            c_1\colvec{a \\ d \\ g}
            +c_2\colvec{b \\ e \\ h}
            +c_3\colvec{c \\ f \\ i}
            =\colvec{0 \\ 0 \\ 0}
          \end{equation*}
         expresses a homogeneous linear system.
         We proceed by writing it in matrix form and applying Gauss's Method.

         We first reduce the matrix to upper-triangular.
         Assume that \( a\neq 0 \).
         With that, we can clear down the first column.
         \begin{equation*}
           \grstep{(1/a)\rho_1}
           \begin{amat}{3}
              1   &b/a   &c/a  &0 \\
              d   &e     &f    &0 \\
              g   &h     &i    &0
            \end{amat}                                            
           \grstep[-g\rho_1+\rho_3]{-d\rho_1+\rho_2}
           \begin{amat}{3}
              1   &b/a           &c/a        &0   \\
              0   &(ae-bd)/a     &(af-cd)/a  &0   \\
              0   &(ah-bg)/a     &(ai-cg)/a  &0
            \end{amat}                                            
         \end{equation*}
         Then we get a $1$ in the second row, second column entry.
         (Assuming for the moment that \( ae-bd\neq 0 \), in order
         to do the row reduction step.)
         \begin{equation*}
           \grstep{(a/(ae-bd))\rho_2}
           \begin{amat}{3}
              1   &b/a           &c/a             &0  \\
              0   &1             &(af-cd)/(ae-bd) &0  \\
              0   &(ah-bg)/a     &(ai-cg)/a       &0
            \end{amat}
         \end{equation*}
         Then, under the assumptions, we perform
         the row operation $((ah-bg)/a)\rho_2+\rho_3$
         to get this.
         \begin{equation*}
           % \grstep{((ah-bg)/a)\rho_2+\rho_3}
           \begin{amat}{3}
              1   &b/a   &c/a                              &0 \\
              0   &1     &(af-cd)/(ae-bd)                   &0 \\
              0   &0     &(aei+bgf+cdh-hfa-idb-gec)/(ae-bd) &0
            \end{amat}
         \end{equation*}
         Therefore, the original system is nonsingular
         if and only if the above \( 3,3 \) entry is nonzero
         (this fraction is defined because of the \( ae-bd\neq 0 \) assumption).
         It equals zero if and only if the numerator is zero. 

         We next worry about the assumptions.
         First, if \( a\neq 0 \) but \( ae-bd=0 \) then we swap
         \begin{multline*}
           \begin{amat}{3}
              1   &b/a           &c/a        &0   \\
              0   &0             &(af-cd)/a  &0   \\
              0   &(ah-bg)/a     &(ai-cg)/a  &0
            \end{amat}                                    \\
           \grstep{\rho_2\leftrightarrow\rho_3}
           \begin{amat}{3}
              1   &b/a           &c/a        &0   \\
              0   &(ah-bg)/a     &(ai-cg)/a  &0   \\
              0   &0             &(af-cd)/a  &0
            \end{amat}
         \end{multline*}
         and conclude that the system is nonsingular if and only if either
         \( ah-bg=0 \) or \( af-cd=0 \).
         That's the same as asking that their product be zero:
         \begin{align*}
            ahaf-ahcd-bgaf+bgcd
            &=0                   \\
            ahaf-ahcd-bgaf+aegc
            &=0                   \\
            a(haf-hcd-bgf+egc)
            &=0
         \end{align*}
         (in going from the first line to the second we've applied the
         case assumption that $ae-bd=0$ by substituting $ae$ for $bd$).
         Since we are assuming that \( a\neq 0 \), 
         we have that \( haf-hcd-bgf+egc=0 \).
         With $ae-bd=0$ we can rewrite this to fit the form we need:~in
         this \( a\neq 0 \) and \( ae-bd=0 \) case, the given system
         is nonsingular when
         \( haf-hcd-bgf+egc-i(ae-bd)=0 \), as required.

         The remaining cases have the same character.
         Do the \( a=0 \) but \( d\neq 0 \) case and the \( a=0 \) and
         \( d=0 \) but \( g\neq 0 \) case by first swapping rows and
         then going on as above.
         The \( a=0 \), \( d=0 \), and \( g=0 \) case is easy\Dash a set with a
         zero vector is linearly dependent, and the formula comes out
         to equal zero.
       \partsitem It is linearly dependent if and only if either vector is a
         multiple of the other.
         That is, it is not independent iff
         \begin{equation*}
           \colvec{a \\ d \\ g}=r\cdot\colvec{b \\ e \\ h}
           \quad\text{or}\quad
           \colvec{b \\ e \\ h}=s\cdot\colvec{a \\ d \\ g}
         \end{equation*}
         (or both) for some scalars $r$ and $s$.
         Eliminating $r$ and $s$ in order to restate this condition only in
         terms of the given letters $a$, $b$, $d$, $e$, $g$, $h$, we have that 
         it is not independent\Dash it is dependent\Dash iff
         \( ae-bd=ah-gb=dh-ge \).
       \partsitem Dependence or independence is a function of the
         indices, so there
         is indeed a formula (although at first glance a person might think
         the formula involves cases: ``if the first component of the first
         vector is zero then \ldots'', this guess turns out not to be 
         correct).

      Recall that two vectors from \( \Re^n \) are perpendicular if and

      \begin{exparts}
         \partsitem Assume that \( \vec{v} \) and \( \vec{w} \) are
           perpendicular nonzero vectors in $\Re^n$, with \( n>1 \).

           apply \( \vec{v} \) to both
           sides to conclude that \( c\cdot\norm{\vec{v}}^2+d\cdot 0=0 \).
           Because \( \vec{v}\neq\zero \) we have that \( c=0 \).
           A similar application of \( \vec{w} \) shows that \( d=0 \).
         \partsitem Two vectors in \( \Re^1 \) are perpendicular if and only if
           at least one of them is zero.

           We define \( \Re^0 \) to be a trivial space, and so both $\vec{v}$
           and $\vec{w}$ are the zero vector.
         \partsitem The right generalization is to look at a set
