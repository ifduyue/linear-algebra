The first chapter covers the dot product operation. 
It inputs a pair of vectors from some $\R^n$ and outputs a scalar.
\begin{equation*}
  \colvec{-1 \\ 2 \\ 3}\dotprod\colvec{1 \\ 0 \\ 3}
  =-1\cdot 1+2\cdot 0+3\cdot 3
  =8
\end{equation*}
In that chapter we did not yet have the term `linear', but
this operation respects both addition
\begin{equation*}
 (\vec{v}_1+\vec{v}_2)\dotprod\vec{w}=\vec{v}_1\dotprod\vec{w}
                                      +\vec{v}_2\dotprod\vec{w}
\qquad
 \vec{v}\dotprod(\vec{w}_1+\vec{w}_2)=\vec{v}\dotprod\vec{w}_1
                                      +\vec{v}\dotprod\vec{w}_2
\end{equation*}
and scalar multiplication.
\begin{equation*}
 (r\vec{v})\dotprod\vec{w}=r(\vec{v}\dotprod\vec{w})
  \qquad
 \vec{v}\dotprod(r\vec{w})=r(\vec{v}\dotprod\vec{w})
\end{equation*}

One interesting thing about the dot product operation
is that it describes the geometry of
$\Re^n\!$. 
Examples are that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their
dot product is zero, and that the length of a vector is determined by  
$\vec{v}\dotprod\vec{v}=\absval{\vec{v}\,}^2$.
Here we will extend this operation, and with it lengths, 
to other vector spaces.
We will use the traditional mathematical notation for the extension, 
which is not a dot but instead is
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$.

To motivate the definition, 
we need more on complex numbers than we reviewed in this 
chapter's opening section.
There, we described~$\C$ as 
the collection of $z=a+bi$ where $a$ and~$b$ are real numbers,
and where $i^2=-1$. 
We also covered addition, scalar multiplication,
subtraction, and multiplication, as well as length.
As for division,  consider $z=(1+2i)/(3+4i)$.
The difference of squares formula
gives $(a+bi)(a-bi)=a^2-(bi)^2=a^2-(-b^2)=a^2+b^2$,
which is a real number.
So, 
multiplying $z$'s numerator and denominator by $3-4i$
gives an $a+bi$ expression.
\begin{equation*}
  z=\frac{1+2i}{3+4i}\cdot\frac{3-4i}{3-4i}
  =
  \frac{(1\cdot 3+2\cdot 4)+(1\cdot (-4)+2\cdot 3)i}{3^2+4^2}
  =
  \frac{11+2i}{25}
  =
  \frac{11}{25}+\frac{2}{25}\,i
\end{equation*}
With that computation in mind, we
define the \definend{conjugate} of a complex number~$z$
to be $\compconj{z}=\compconj{a+bi}=a-bi$, so that $z\compconj{z}=\absval{z}^2$.
Dividing that equation by $\absval{z}^2$ gives $z\compconj{z}/\absval{z}^2=1$
and so  
every nonzero complex number has a multiplicative inverse,
$z^{-1}\!=\compconj{z}/\absval{z}^2$.
% (and thus $\absval{z}=1$ if and only if $z^{-1}=\compconj{z}$).
Observe that a complex number is a real number if and only if 
it equals its conjugate, 
that $\compconj{z_1+z_2}=\compconj{z_1}+\compconj{z_2}$,
and that $\compconj{z_1\cdot z_2}=\compconj{z_1}\cdot\compconj{z_2}$.
Plotting $z=a+bi$ on the 
complex plane\index{complex plane} 
illustrates the conjugate.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{jc/asy/innerproduct000.pdf}
\end{center}
This picture makes clear that 
$z+\compconj{z}=(a+bi)+(a-bi)$ equals
$2\cdot a$, which we write as $2\cdot\RE{z}$.
(Read `$\RE{z}$' aloud as ``the real part of $z$.'')
% It also shows the \definend{argument}, $\arg(z)$, the angle that
% $z$ makes with the real axis.

We are ready to generalize the dot product and length operations. 
Dot product and length are familiar in spaces that are collections of real column vectors but we have seen many examples of 
vector spaces far removed from those, such as 
the spaces of polynomials, $\polyspace_n$. 
In such a space it is not obvious
what would be a useful or natural definition of length.
For some insight into what to do,
consider the complex vector spaces~$\C^n$.

With dot product in real spaces in mind, 
the natural first guess here is to try 
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$
as the linear combination of the components, so that in the~$\C^2$
case
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{v}=\colvec{a_{1,1}+b_{1,1}i \\ a_{2,1}+b_{2,1}i}
  \qquad
  \vec{w}=\colvec{a_{1,2}+b_{1,2}i \\ a_{2,2}+b_{2,2}i}
\end{equation*}
the guess for $\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$ is 
$(a_{1,1}+b_{1,1}i)\cdot(a_{1,2}+b_{1,2}i)+(a_{2,1}+b_{2,1}i)\cdot(a_{2,2}+b_{2,2}i)$.
But this won't do.
We are investigating lengths,
so we want that $\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}=\absval{\vec{v}\,}^2\!$,
and thus we don't want that $\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}$ equals
$(a_1+b_1i)(a_1+b_1i)+(a_2+b_2i)(a_2+b_2i)$.
Instead we want something like
$(a_1+b_1i)(a_1-b_1i)+(a_2+b_2i)(a_2-b_2i)$.
Consequently, we adopt this definition for $\C^2\!$.
\begin{equation*}
  \innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}
  =(a_{1,1}+b_{1,1}i)\cdot(a_{1,2}-b_{1,2}i)\,+\,(a_{2,1}+b_{2,1}i)\cdot(a_{2,2}-b_{2,2}i)
\end{equation*}
The 
\definend{Hermitian inner product} 
is:\index{inner product!Hermitian}\index{Hermitian inner product}
where vectors $\vec{v},\vec{w}\in\C^n$ 
have components $v_0$, \ldots~$v_n$ and $w_0$, \ldots~$w_n$, then
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}=v_1\compconj{w}_1+\cdots+v_n\compconj{w}_n$.
Notice that this extends the dot product in the sense that
if we fall back to reals, taking the $b$'s be zero, then
it equals $\vec{v}\dotprod\vec{w}$.

This operation inputs two vectors but outputs a scalar.
Here is an example.
\begin{align*}
  \innerprod{\colvec{1+2i \\ 3+4i}}{\colvec{5+6i \\ 7+8i}}
  &=(1+2i)(5-6i)+(3+4i)(7-8i)                     \\[-2ex]
  &=(17+4i)+(53+4i)=70+8i
\end{align*}

Hermitian inner product is linear in the first input:~checking that
$\innerprod{\vec{v}_1+\vec{v}_2}{\vec{w}}
 = \innerprod{\vec{v}_1}{\vec{w}}
   +\innerprod{\vec{v}_2}{\vec{w}}$
and that
$\innerprod{z\cdot\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}
     =z\cdot\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$
is straightforward.
But it is not linear in the second because
while
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}_1+\vec{w}_2}
 = \innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}_1}
   +\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}_2}$
holds, for scalar multiplication a conjugation appears:
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{z\cdot\vec{w}}
     =\compconj{z}\cdot\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$.
Of course, this difference is here because 
in the definition the second input is conjugated
while the first is not.
Another result of this asymmetry is that 
$\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}}\neq \innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$; rather,
$\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}}=\compconj{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}$.

Hermitian inner product is one way, in a particular set of vector spaces, 
to extend dot product.
There are lots of others, in lots of spaces.
But we want our extensions to lead to a reasonable notion of length.
For that,
an \definend{inner product} is an operation
that inputs two vectors from a real or complex vector space 
and outputs a scalar, and that
satisfies three conditions.
Condition~(1) is that it is linear in the first input, so
$\innerprod{\vec{v}_1+\vec{v}_2}{\vec{w}}
 = \innerprod{\vec{v}_1}{\vec{w}}
   +\innerprod{\vec{v}_2}{\vec{w}}$
and $\innerprod{z\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}
     =z\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$.
% (Some presentations take inner product 
% to be linear in the second input; more on this
% at the end of this Topic.)
Condition~(2) is that
$\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}}=\compconj{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}$.
Observe that as a consequence, 
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}$ equals its conjugate and
so is a real number.
Condition~(3) says about that real number that
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}\geq 0$ for all $\vec{v}$, with 
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}= 0$ if and only if $\vec{v}=\zero$.

A vector space along with an inner product operation is an
\definend{inner product space}.
(In the prior paragraph we used the $\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$ notation 
for any inner product at all, while earlier we used it for the specific case of
the Hermetian inner product.
This duplication won't cause confusion because in an inner product space there
is exactly one such operation, so there will never be several to tell apart.)

Each real vector space $\R^n$ along with dot product is an inner product space. 
Hermitian inner product makes any complex vector space~$\C^n$ into 
an inner product space.
The verification of each is in the exercises.

An example which looks quite different 
is the real vector space whose members are
real valued functions that are continuous on the 
closed interval $\closedinterval{0}{1}$.
Let the inner product be this.
\begin{equation*}
  \innerprod{f}{g}=\int_{0}^1 f(t)\cdot g(t)\,dt
\end{equation*}
This satisfies the inner product definition
condition~(1) because  
$\int_{0}^1 (f_1(t)+f_2(t))\cdot g(t)\,dt$ equals 
$\int_{0}^1 f_1(t)g(t)\,dt+\int_{0}^1 f_2(t)g(t)\,dt$
by a result from elementary Calculus,
and a similar result holds for scalar multiplication. 
It satisfies~(2) because for real numbers conjugation has no effect,
and $f(t)g(t)$ equals $g(t)f(t)$. 
For condition~(3), if~$f$ is not the zero function then 
the square $f(t)\cdot f(t)$ is greater than~$0$ for some 
$\hat{t}\in \closedinterval{0}{1}$.
By continuity then, the square is greater than zero for a subinterval
around~$\hat{t}$,
and so the area under the curve is greater than~$0$.

We next generalize the length operation.
We shall consider an operation to be a reasonable extension of length
if it inputs vectors and outputs real numbers and if it satisfies
three conditions; any such operation
we shall call a \definend{norm},\index{norm} and denote~$\norm{\vec{v}}$. 
The first condition is that $\norm{\vec{v}}\geq 0$, 
and that $\norm{\vec{v}}= 0$ if and only if $\vec{v}=\zero$.
The second is that rescaling a vector will rescale 
its norm, specifically that 
$\norm{z\cdot \vec{v}}=\absval{z}\cdot\norm{\vec{v}}$.
The third condition is 
the Triangle Inequality,\index{Triangle Inequality} 
that $\norm{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}\leq\norm{\vec{v}}+\norm{\vec{w}}$.

A familiar example of a norm in the vector space~$\R^n$ is the ordinary
Euclidean length, $\norm{\vec{v}}=\sqrt{\smashdp{v_1^2+\cdots+v_n^2}}$.

Another example is on the real vector space of matrices
$\matspace_{\nbym{n}{m}}$.
Let the norm of a matrix, $\norm{M}$, be the largest absolute value 
over all of the entries.  
Condition~(1) is clear, as is condition~(2).
Condition~(3) is the ordinary Triangle Inequality for reals,
$\absval{a+b}\leq\absval{a}+\absval{b}$.

% Still another example of a norm operation 
% is on the vector space of continuous real-valued functions 
% on the closed interval $\closedinterval{0}{1}$.  
% \begin{equation*}
%   \norm{f}
%   =\int_{x=0}^1 \absval{f(x)}\,dx
%   \tag{$*$}
% \end{equation*}
% Verifying the three conditions in the definition is an exercise.

In the motivation of the definition of inner product, we said that we 
want our extension of dot product to yield a reasonable notion of
length.
We now have the definitions that we need to make that precise.
Let 
$\norm{\vec{v}}=\sqrt{\smashdp{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}}}$.
We will show that this satisfies the 
three conditions in the definition of a norm.
We covered the first condition 
in the discussion of inner product.
To verify the second, 
$\norm{z\cdot\vec{v}}
=\sqrt{\smashdp{\innerprod{z\vec{v}}{z\vec{v}}}}
=\sqrt{\smashdp{z\compconj{z}\cdot\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}}}
=\sqrt{z\compconj{z}}\cdot\sqrt{\smashdp{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}}}
=\absval{z}\cdot\sqrt{\smashdp{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}}}$.

For the third condition we will again, as in the first
chapter, relate it to the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality,\index{Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality}
$\absval{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}\leq \norm{\vec{v}}\cdot\norm{\vec{w}}$.
The proof of the inequality here is an extension of, 
but more involved than, the proof in the first chapter. 
Consider the difference $\vec{v}-z\cdot\vec{w}$ as $z\in\C$ varies.
This vector's norm is a nonnegative real,
$0\leq \norm{\vec{v}-z\cdot\vec{w}}^2
   =\innerprod{\vec{v}-z\vec{w}}{\vec{v}-z\vec{w}}$.
Linearity gives
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}-z\vec{w}}
  -z\cdot\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}-z\vec{w}}$
and then
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}
  -\compconj{z}\cdot\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}
  -z\cdot\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}}
  +z\compconj{z}\cdot\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{w}}$.
We have this for all $z\in\C$.
\begin{equation*}
 0
  \leq\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}
  -\compconj{z}\cdot\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}
  -z\cdot\compconj{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}
  +z\compconj{z}\cdot\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{w}}
\end{equation*}

Take 
$z=\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}/\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{w}}$
(if $\vec{w}=\zero$ then the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality is trivial, so we
ignore this case).
Its denominator is a real number so
$\compconj{z}=\compconj{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}/\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{w}}$,
and thus plugging it into the second term gives 
$\compconj{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}/\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{w}}$.
Plugging into the third term gives the same,
as does plugging into the last term.
Combining the three like terms gives this.
\begin{equation*}
 0
  \leq\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}
  -\frac{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}\compconj{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}}{\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{w}}}
  =\norm{\vec{v}}^2
  -\frac{\absval{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}^2}{\norm{\vec{w}}^2}
\end{equation*}
Rearranging and clearing the denominator gives the desired 
inequality.

With that, we can prove the Triangle Inequality.
Again, this extends the argument in the first chapter.
\begin{align*}
  \norm{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}^2
  =\innerprod{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}  
  &=\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}
    +\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}  
    +\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}}  
    +\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{w}}   \\ 
  &=\norm{\vec{v}}^2
    +\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}  
    +\compconj{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}  
    +\norm{\vec{w}}^2              \\   
  &=\norm{\vec{v}}^2
    +2\cdot\RE{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}  
    +\norm{\vec{w}}^2      \\
  &\leq\norm{\vec{v}}^2
    +2\absval{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}}  
    +\norm{\vec{w}}^2     \\
% \end{align*}
\intertext{Apply Cauchy-Schwartz.}
  &\leq\norm{\vec{v}}^2
    +2\cdot\norm{\vec{v}}\cdot\norm{\vec{w}}
    +\norm{\vec{w}}^2      
  =(\norm{\vec{v}}+\norm{\vec{w}})^2         
\end{align*}
Taking the square root of both sides gives the result.

We pause to see one more connection between inner products, norm, and geometry.
Here is the familiar parallelogram diagram for the sum of two vectors,
where besides $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$ we also show $\vec{v}-\vec{w}$. 
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{jc/asy/innerproduct001.pdf}
\end{center}
We will prove the 
\definend{parallelogram identity},\index{parallelogram identity}
$\absval{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}^2+\absval{\vec{v}-\vec{w}}^2=2\absval{\vec{v}}^2+2\absval{\vec{w}}^2$
(This has the nice statement that in a parallelogram the sum of the squares 
of the diagonals equals the sum of the squares of the sides.)
Although the drawing above shows the plane, where we usually use dot product 
notation and write length as $\absval{\vec{v}\,}$, 
here we will use the notation for inner product and norm.

As above, expand
$
  \norm{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}^2=\innerprod{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}
$
by using additivity of the first input and then the second. 
\begin{align*}
  \norm{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}^2
  &=\innerprod{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}           \\
   % &=\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}+\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}+\vec{w}} \\
  &=\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}            
   +\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}
   +\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}}
   +\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{w}}
  =\norm{\vec{v}}^2            
   +\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}
   +\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}}
   +\norm{\vec{w}}^2
\end{align*}
The same expansion for $\innerprod{\vec{v}-\vec{w}}{\vec{v}-\vec{w}}$
gives this.
\begin{equation*}
  \norm{\vec{v}-\vec{w}}^2
  =\innerprod{\vec{v}-\vec{w}}{\vec{v}-\vec{w}}
  =\norm{\vec{v}}^2
   -\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}
   -\innerprod{\vec{w}}{\vec{v}}
   +\norm{\vec{w}}^2
\end{equation*}
Adding the two gives the desired result. 

Now, with the inner product and norm operations, 
even in spaces where there is no obvious geometry
we can interpret geometric ideas. 
An example is that can generalize distance to a
\definend{metric}\index{metric} 
operation
$d(\vec{v},\vec{w})=\norm{\vec{v}-\vec{w}}$.
Another example is that we can say that
vectors $\vec{v}$ and~$\vec{w}$ are orthogonal when 
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}=0$,
and we can extend the Gram-Schmidt process
to any finite dimensional inner product space.

A technical comment:~we have defined a norm operation from the inner product, 
as $\norm{\vec{v}}=\sqrt{\smashdp{\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}}}$,
and then derived the parallelogram identity.
Also true is that if a norm satisfies this identity then it
arises from an inner product, as 
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}
  =(1/2)\cdot(\norm{\vec{v}+\vec{w}}^2-\norm{\vec{v}}^2-\norm{\vec{w}}^2)$.
However, the proof is beyond our scope.

A norm does not arise from an inner product can happen;
we saw one above.
On the real vector space $\matspace_{\nbyn{2}}$, let the
norm of a matrix $\norm{M}$ be the largest absolute value of any entry.
Consider these matrices.
\begin{equation*}
  M_1=
  \begin{mat}
  1  &2 \\
  3  &4  
  \end{mat}
  \qquad
  M_2=
  \begin{mat}
  8  &7  \\
  6  &5
  \end{mat}
\end{equation*}
Obviously, $\norm{M_1}=4$ and~$\norm{M_2}=8$.
Also easy to check are that $\norm{M_1+M_2}=9$
and $\norm{M_1-M_2}=7$.
Thus $\norm{M_1+M_2}^2+\norm{M_1-M_2}^2=130$, 
while $2(\norm{M_1}^2+\norm{M_2}^2)=160$,
and they are unequal.

We close with a remark about our definition of inner product.
Some authors, particularly in physics, define the inner product 
so that it is linear in the second argument instead of the first. 
Where we write $\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$, 
these authors write $\langle y\, |\, x\rangle$. 
This is the
\definend{bra-ket notation}\index{bra-ket notation}\index{inner product!compared with bra-ket} 
that is standard in quantum mechanics.

\begin{exercises}
\item 
Verify that $\R^n$ along with dot product is an inner product space.
\begin{answer}
The opening paragraph of this Topic notes that dot product is linear
in both inputs, and so the first condition is satisfied.
Condition~(2) concerns conjugation, 
which has no effect on reals, and 
so this condition is trivially satisfied. 
Condition~(3) requires that the length (the ordinary Euclidean length
in $n$-dimensional real space) be zero if and only if the vector is~$\zero$.
If the vector has components $v_1$, \ldots~$v_n$ then
$v_1^2+\cdots v_n^2=0$ if and only if all the components are zero.
\end{answer}

\item
Show that Hermitian inner product on the two-dimensional vector space~$\C^2$ 
satisfies the three conditions in the definition of inner product. 
\begin{answer}
The development in the Topic body proves~(1) and~(2).
For~(3), suppose that 
two members  $\vec{v},\vec{w}$ of~$\C^n$
have $i$-th components $v_i$ and $w_i$, so that
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}=v_1\compconj{w}_1+\cdots+v_n\compconj{w}_n$.
Then $\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}=v_1\compconj{v}_1+\cdots+v_n\compconj{v}_n$
equals $\absval{\vec{v}_1}^2+\cdots \absval{\vec{v}_n}^2$, 
which clearly equals~$0$ if and only if each component is~$0$.
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}
Condition~(1), linearity in the first argument, is easy.

       e  &f  \\
       g  &h
      \end{mat}
    }
  \end{split}
\end{multline*}
Scalar multiplication is just as routine.
Condition~(2) concerns conjugation, 
which has no effect on reals and 
so this condition is trivially satisfied. 
For~(3), of course $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2\geq 0$, with equality if and only
if each entry is zero.

\item Consider the real vector space of quadratic polynomials~$\polyspace_2$.
Show that this is an inner product operation:
$\innerprod{a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0}{b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0}=a_2b_2+a_1b_1+a_0b_0$. 
Consider the resulting norm.
What is $\norm{x^2-1}$?
\begin{answer}
Condition~(1) is that it is linear in the first input.
Verifying that this operation respects addition is routine
\begin{multline*}
  \innerprod{(a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0)+(c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0)}{b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0}  \\
  \begin{split}
    &=(a_2+c_2)b_2+(a_1+c_1)b_1+(a_0+c_0)b_0             \\
    &=(a_2b_2+a_1b_1+a_0b_0)+(c_2b_2+c_1b_1+c_0b_0)             \\
    &=\innerprod{(a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0)}{b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0}      \\
      &\qquad+\innerprod{(c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0)}{b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0}
  \end{split}
\end{multline*}
as is verifying that it respects scalar multiplication.
Because this is a real vector space, and conjugation has no effect on
real number scalars, it satisfies condition~(2).
For condition~(3), let $\vec{v}=a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$.
Then $\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}=a_2^2+a_1^2+a_0^2$ is clearly non-negative,
and is equal to~$0$ if and only if $\vec{v}$ is the zero polynomial.

As to the norm of $x^2-1$, we have this.
\begin{equation*} 
 \norm{x^2-1}=\sqrt{\innerprod{x^2-1}{x^2-1}}=\sqrt{1^2+0^2+(-1)^2}=\sqrt{2}
\end{equation*}
\end{answer}

\item Verify that the set of real valued functions that are continuous on the 
closed interval $\closedinterval{0}{1}$ is a vector space.
\begin{answer}
The ten conditions in the definition of a vector space
are consequences of results from Calculus.
For example, the first condition is closure under addition and we
have that the sum of two continuous functions is a continuous function 
in Calculus.
(Although, often a student does not see a completely precise proof 
until a later class.)
Similarly, addition of two functions is commutative.
Of course, the zero vector is the function $f(x)=0$, which is continuous.

\item
Show that an attempted definition of $\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{w}}$
on $\C^n$ that is linear in both inputs
loses that $\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}$ gives the length.
\begin{answer}
Suppose that
$\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}$ is greater than or equal to~$0$ for all
complex vectors~$\vec{v}$.
Then linearity in both inputs gives
$0\leq \innerprod{i\vec{v}}{i\vec{v}}
  =i\innerprod{\vec{v}}{i\vec{v}}
  =i^2\innerprod{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}}\leq 0$.
\end{answer}


% \item Show that this operation
% on the vector space of continuous real-valued functions 
% over $\closedinterval{0}{1}$ satisfies the

% \begin{equation*}
%   \norm{f}

% \begin{answer}
% The first condition holds because the integral of an absolute
