# First have to find the directory in which this is being compiled,
#  .../src so that it can go in the TEXINPUTS and MPINPUTS variable.

my $compile_dir = getcwd;
# for debugging: print "!!!!! compile_dir is ",$compile_dir,"\n";


# To put .sty files in other dirs you need to put the .sty's into
# the path where LaTeX searches.  For instance, the MetaPost files
# will not compile without this.

# ===== MetaPost-handling ========
# If LaTeX reports that to compile book.tex you are missing a file ending in
# .1 then latexmk will look for a file of the same name (including
# the path) and run the sub 'mpost' on it.
#   I need a rule for ending in 2, 3, etc so I add them all.

# is to cd to the directory containing the .mp file so it can write
# and read the .mpx file, etc.

# ===== Asymptote-handling ========
# If LaTeX reports that to compile book.tex you are missing a file ending in
# .pdf then latexmk will look for a file of the same name (including
# the path) and run the sub 'asy2pdf' on it.

# This is adapted from the version that comes with latexmk.  The change
# is to only use the dependencies that involve pdf.  As with the metapost
# part, I go to the directory, call asy there, and come back.

# I use asy files to produce multiple pdf files.  Thus, jc/asy/wilber.asy
# produces wilber001.pdf, wilber002.pdf etc.  This is convenient because
# they share common code.  But this is not compatible with latexmk, which
# does not allow add_cus_dep("asy","000.pdf",0,"asy2pdf"); (I have written
# J Collins the maintainer of latexmk about it.)
