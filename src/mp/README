The .mp files are MetaPost.

The .tex file is useful for showing the output of running MetaPost.  Copy the
.tex file to the directory you are interested in and run something like this.

cp src/mp/test.tex src/det/mp
cd src/det/mp
TEXINPUTS=../..//:$TEXINPUTS MPINPUTS=../..//:$MPINPUTS mpost ch4
(edit test.tex and change the extension to what you want to see)
TEXINPUTS=../..//:$TEXINPUTS MPINPUTS=../..//:$MPINPUTS pdflatex test
(result is a .pdf)
