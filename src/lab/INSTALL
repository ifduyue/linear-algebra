Notes on getting the lab to compile.  These are under Linux, with TeX Live.
I have Ubuntu 20, and TeX Live 2021 (downloaded online, not installed
using apt).

0) Install the font used for listings.  The file ProggyCleanSage.zip contains
the font and style files.  To find the directory to install, run this.

  $ kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL
  /usr/local/share/texmf

Go there, and unzip the file.

  $ cd /usr/local/share/texmf
  $ sudo unzip ProggyClean.zip

Now you must register the .map file

  $ cd fonts/map/dvips/ProggyCleanSage
  $ sudo updmap-sys --force --enable Map=ProggyCleanSage.map

Also install the font used for titles.  From
  https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fotns/bera
get bera.zip.  Again go to the local directory and unzip.

  $ cd /usr/local/share/texmf
  $ sudo unzip bera.zip

Again you must register its .map file.

  $ cd fonts/map/dvips
  $ sudo updmap-sys --force --enable Map=bera.map

Now, put all that in the file name database.

  $ sudo texhash

1) Next, Sage.  The main technical problem in the lab document is
getting the console information from Sage.  Fortunately, a recent
update to sagetex.sty has provided a means that is much better than I
used in the past.  So, you must have at least the 2019 version.

I installed Sage using my distribution's package manager. (Note that
on Ubuntu 20 you want to install "sagemath", not "sage" and not
"sagemath-common".)  If I run this 

  $ sage -version

then it says Sage version 9.0 with a release of 2020-01-01.

There are two relevant files.  There is sagetex.sty, which goes into
the TeX directory tree, and there is sagetex.py, which goes into the
Sage directory tree.  They need to be the same version.

I checked sagetex.sty as here

  $ kpsewhich sagetex.sty
  /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/sagetex/sagetex.sty
  $ less /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/sagetex/sagetex.sty

(to get out of less, use 'q' to quit).  It shows a version date of
2019/11/14 (v3.4).  I checked sagetex.py as here.

  $ find /usr -name sagetex.py -print
  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sagetex.py
  $ less /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sagetex.py

It has the same date, 2019/11/14 v3.4.  So I am good.

(If they did not agree, I would have gotten sagetex from CTAN, unzipped
it into TEXMFLOCAL, and run 'pdflatex sagetex.ins' and 'pdflatex sagetex.dtx'.
Then I would run 'sudo texhash' to make the TeX system aware of sagetex.sty,
and I would copy sagetex.py to /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages to make Sage
aware of sagetex.py)

2) The script runlab.sh should compile the lab.  It sets up TEXINPUTS,
calls LaTeX, then runs the PythonTeX script, then runs the Sage python
script, then runs LaTeX again.

Warning: there is a point where the compilation seems to stall (about
page 70).  Don't lose heart, it is just thinking.

3) But the first time you do not yet have all the figures, and the .sage
commands, etc.  You will find yourself in a very boring cycle of runlab.sh,
followed by hitting x twice, followed by runlab.sh again.  Better is to
follow these steps.

  a) sage lab.sagetex.sage
  b) cd asy
     asy ellipsoid1
     cd ..

and then this.

  c) runlab.sh
