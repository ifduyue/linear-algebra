Notes on getting the lab to compile.  These are under Linux, with TeX Live.
I have Ubuntu 20, and TeX Live 2021 (downloaded online, not installed
using apt).

0) Install the font used for listings.  The file ProggyClean.zip contains
the font and style files.  To find the directory to install, run this.

  $ kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL
  /usr/local/share/texmf

Go there, and unzip the file.

  $ cd /usr/local/share/texmf
  $ sudo unzip ProggyClean.zip



If you have Windows then you have to open the .sh file and see what is in there
and run it in the terminal by hand.

1) The main problem is getting the console information from Sage.  Fortunately,
a recent update to sagetex.sty has provided the means.  So, you must have
the 2019 version.  Run sage from the command line, and then ask for the
version number.

  $ sage
  sage: sagetex.__version__
  '[2019/01/09 v3.2 embedding Sage into LaTeX documents]'

If you don't have it already then it takes some installation.

Get a sagetex.sty with a version of 3.2 (dated Jan 9, 2019) or later.
Put it in your local TeX tree and compile it.  I followed
these steps under Ubuntu Linux.  Obviously your mileage may vary.

    cd /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/
    sudo mv /home/ftpmaint/Downloads/sagetex.zip .
    --remove any old directory sagetex/--
    sudo unzip sagetex
    cd sagetex
    sudo pdflatex sagetex.ins
    sudo pdflatex sagetex.dtx
    sudo texhash

Here is the tricky part.  When you run "sudo pdflatex sagetex.ins" you get told
to move the .sty to where LaTeX will find it, which is taken care of by the
later "texhash" command.  But you also get told to move sagetex.py to
where sage can find it.  I moved mine into the sage dir tree.

    sudo cp sagetex.py /usr/lib/sagemath/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagetex.py


2) The script runlab.sh should compile the lab.  It sets up TEXINPUTS,
calls xelatex, then runs the PythonTeX script, then runs the Sage python
script, then runs xelatex again.

Warning: there is a point where the compilation seems to stall (about
page 70).  Don't lose heart, it is just thinking.

3) But the first time you do not yet have all the figures, and the .sage
commands, etc.  You will find yourself in a very boring cycle of runlab.sh,
followed by hitting x twice, followed by runlab.sh again.  Better is to
follow these steps.

  a) sage lab.sagetex.sage
  b) cd asy
     asy ellipsoid1
     cd ..

and then this.

  c) runlab.sh
