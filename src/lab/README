linear-algebra/lab/README

This material is the source for the lab manual associated with the 
text _Linear Algebra_ by Jim Hefferon.  It is Free; see the page
http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra for the details and contact
information (I appreciate comments and bug reports).



COMPILING 

The manual requires two nonstandard fonts, Bera Sans and ProggyClean. 
The second is in the fonts/ subdirectory while the first is widely available
on the internet.

Further, you may well have to adjust the font paths in lab.cls.  Note that
the paths end in a '/'; that's important.

Note that it requires running "xelatex --shell-escape lab".

I had to install the LaTeX package sagetex (from www.ctan.org) and the
Python package pexpect, personally, last time I got it to run.

For me, on Ubuntu 12.04 with TeX Live 2012, running ./make_lab.sh will
after a while produce the book as a PDF.  (This requires Sage and
Python 2.7; I do not know if it will run with Python 3.)  I don't know
anything about other platforms.



NOTES

1) This document is experimental in a number of ways.  For instance, I use
the second person.  I was also not sure of the right blend of theory-based
work and just here-it-is work.

I will feel free in the future to abandon any experiments here that I 
do not believe help students learn.

2) I wrote runrepl.sty that pulls output from the Sage repl (which proved to
be hairy as it adjusts for lines that move left off the screen), and the
Python repl.  Perhaps the sagetex package would have been better, but
I wanted to get the prompts, errors, etc. 
 
3) I do not provide exercises, but leave that to an instructor.  That may 
change, particularly if it becomes easier to run a Sage notebook server.
