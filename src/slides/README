slides/README

These are classroom slides for use with Jim Hefferon's _Linear
Algebra_.  For instance, one/one_i.pdf covers Chapter One, Section I.

They are coupled to the text.  The statement of the theorems, lemmas,
etc., are taken from the book's source code.  So there is guaranteed
to be no inconsistency between, say, a definition in the book and the
one in these slides.  On the other hand, all the examples and
computations are different in the slides than in the book, so students
have extra examples, in case that helps.

For the latest version of these files, including the LaTeX source and 
other goodies, see https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra.

1) Each section's slides come in three versions.  As an example, take
Chapter One, Section I.  Here are the three
 a) one/one_i.pdf: the basic version. This is what I use in class.
 a) one/one_i_allproofs.pdf: include all the proofs. version.  My basic
     slides skip some proofs in favor of illustrative examples.
 a) one/one_i_handout.pdf: the same as one/one_i.pdf, except that there
 is just a single page for each slide.  That is, in the basic version,
 some pages are revealed over two or three clicks. That is suppressed
 in these slides.  Some instructors post this version on their intranet,
 so if students print out some of all of the slides then they don't get
 any repeated materials.
 
2) Besides covering what is in the book, there are a few supplemental
slides that cover a bit extra; these have a filename with an "_a" extension.
For instance, three_ii_a.pdf elaborates on the geometric action of
transformations of the plane, with some pictures that my students find
helpful (some of this is from the lab manual).

When I teach the class, I use the supplemental slides.  I do these after
the relevant section, that is, three_ii_a.pdf after three_ii.pdf, 
except that I do five_ii_a.pdf before five_ii.pdf.

NOTES
2021-Oct-04 JH  Revised for new printing.  Note README.opacity about the
  issue getting Asymptote to process graphics with opacity.
2016-Jun-05 JH  Revised for new book version.  Upgrade a subspace graphics
  to asymptote node version 5.0.
2015-Jan-03 JH  Extensive revision, with many examples added.  Also included
  some optional ones with "_a" extension.
2012-Jun-18 Jim Hefferon  I have not yet tested these in class.  No doubt
  there are some errors.  I would appreciate bug reports.  See the 
  contact information at the above web page.
