slides/README

These are classroom slides for use with Jim Hefferon's _Linear Algebra_.

They are coupled to the text.  For instance, one_i.pdf covers Chapter One,
Section I.  Note that through some deep LaTeX magic the text of the theorems,
lemmas, etc., are taken from the book's source.  So there is guaranteed to 
be no inconsistency between, say, a definition in the book and the one in 
these slides.  On the other hand, all the examples and computations are 
different in the slides than in the book so students see twice as many of 
these. 

A few supplemental slides that cover a bit extra; these have a filename 
with an "_a" extension.  For instance, three_ii_a.pdf elaborates on the 
geometric action of transformations of the plane, with some pictures 
that my students find helpful.

There are also variants that that include all the proofs; for these the
filenames end in "_allproofs".

Personally, I use the versions that omit some proofs in favor of examples.
I also use the supplemental slides.  I do these after the relevant section,
except that I do five_ii_a.pdf before five_ii.pdf 

For the latest version of these files, including the LaTeX source and 
other goodies, see http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra.

NOTES
2016-Jun-05 JH  Revised for new book version.  Upgrade a subspace graphics
  to asymptote node version 5.0.
2015-Jan-03 JH  Extensive revision, with many examples added.  Also included
  some optional ones with "_a" extension.
2012-Jun-18 Jim Hefferon  I have not yet tested these in class.  No doubt
  there are some errors.  I would appreciate bug reports.  See the 
  contact information at the above web page.
